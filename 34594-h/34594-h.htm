<h2><span>EDITOR'S PREFACE.</span></h2>


<p>Every careful student of history is aware that it is no longer possible
to write the general history of any important country from the original
sources; on any period, the materials which accumulate in a year are more
than can be assimilated by one mind in three years. The general historian
must use the results of others' work. It is therefore essential that the
great phases of political and constitutional development be treated in
monographs, each devoted to a single, limited subject and each prepared
on a careful and scientific method.</p>

<p>This first number of the historical series of the Fay House Monographs
aims to discuss the single topic of Fugitive Slaves. Mrs. McDougall has
drawn together and compared many cases found in obscure sources, and has
perhaps been able to correct some commonly received impressions on this
neglected subject.</p>

<p>Even in its limited range this does not pretend to be a complete work in
the sense that all the available cases are discussed or recorded. The
effort has been made to use the cases as illustrations of principles, and
to add such bibliography as may direct the reader to further details. The
appendix of laws is as full as it was possible to make it from the
collections in the Boston Public and Massachusetts State Libraries. If
the monograph prove useful to the student of American history, it will
meet the expectations of author and editor.</p>

<h2><span>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</span></h2>


<p>The following monograph was written while the author was a student in the
"Harvard Annex" as a study in the Seminary course given by Professor
Albert Bushnell Hart. The work has continued during parts of the four
years since 1887. The effort has been to trace in some measure the
development of public sentiment upon the subject, to prepare an outline
of Colonial legislation and of the work of Congress during the entire
period, and to give accounts of typical cases illustrative of conditions
and opinions. Only a few of the more important cases are described
minutely, but a critical list of the authorities may be found in the
bibliographical appendix.</p>

<p>The thanks of the author are due first to Professor Hart, under whose
direction and with whose assistance and encouragement the monograph has
been prepared; then to Miss Anna B. Thompson, without whose careful
training in the Thayer Academy and continued sympathy, the work could not
have been undertaken. Many thanks are due also to the authorities of the
Library of Harvard College for the use, in the alcoves, of their large
and conveniently arranged collection of books and pamphlets on United
States History, and to the assistants in the Boston Public and
Massachusetts State Libraries for courteous aid. Colonel T. W. Higginson
has kindly examined the chapter on the cases from 1850 to 1860,
suggesting some interesting details; and Mr. Arthur Gilman has read the
whole in proof, and made many valuable suggestions.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;1. <a id="Elem"></a>Elements of colonial slavery.</b>&mdash;By the middle of the seventeenth
century, the settlements made in America by the English, Dutch, and
Swedes were arranged for the most part in a line of little colonies
closely following the Atlantic coast. To the west, wide forests and
plains, broken only by the paths of the Indian, stretched on to the
Pacific; while long intervals of unpopulated country separated the
colonists on the north from the French in Canada, and on the south from
the Spaniards in Florida.</p>

<p>In all the colonies thus grouped together, the system of slavery had
already become well established, and with its institution the question of
the escape and return of the slaves had necessarily arisen. The
conditions of the country, both physical and social, gave unusual
facilities for flight. The wild woods, the Indian settlements, or the
next colony, peopled by a foreign race, and perhaps as yet without firmly
established government, offered to the slave a refuge and possibly
protection. Escape, therefore, as a peculiar danger, demanded peculiar
remedies. Though it is the purpose of this monograph not so much to study
the detail of legislation or escape in the colonies as to deal
with the period from 1789 to 1865, a slight sketch of the intercolonial
laws and provisions which preceded and in part suggested later
legislation will first be necessary.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the introduction of slavery, in 1619, we begin
to find regulations made by the colonists upon this subject. At first
they applied solely to their own territory, but soon agreements were
entered into among several colonies, or between a colony and the Indians
or the French in Canada. These acts and agreements recognized not only
the negro, as at a later period, but also the white and the Indian slave.
There existed in some of the colonies of this time a peculiar class of
white people, who received no wages, and were bound to their <a id="masters"></a>masters.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
Usually these redemptioners were laborers or handicraftsmen, but
sometimes they were persons of education who had committed a crime, and
were sold according to law for a term of years, or for life. One of the
class is curiously connected with the education of no less a person than
George Washington. An unpublished autobiography of the Reverend John
Boucher, who from 1760 to the Revolution was a teacher and preacher in
Virginia, contains the following paragraph noticing the fact:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Mr. Washington was the second of five sons, of parents distinguished
neither for their rank nor fortune.... George, who, like most people
thereabouts at that time, had no other education than reading, writing,
and accounts, which he was taught by a convict servant whom his father
bought for a schoolmaster, first set out in the world as a surveyor of
Orange <a id="County"></a>County."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p><b>§&nbsp;2. R<a id="egula"></a>egulations as to fugitives.</b>&mdash;The earliest regulation upon this
subject is found among the freedoms and exemptions granted by the West
India Company, in 1629, "to all Patroons, Masters, or Private Persons"
who would agree to settle in New Netherlands. The authorities promised to
do all in their power to return to their masters any slaves or colonists
fleeing from <a id="service"></a>service.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>


<p>A little later, the Swedish colonists in Pennsylvania asked from their
government the same privilege of reclaiming <a id="ugi"></a>fugitives.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>  The preamble of
an act against fugitives in East Jersey, in 1686, explains these
provisions. They found that "the securing of such persons
as Run
away, or otherwise absent themselves from their master's lawfull
Occasion," was "a material encouragement to such Persons as come into
this country to settle Plantations and Populate the <a id="Province"></a>Province.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> In many
of the Southern colonies, as Maryland and South Carolina, so severe were
the acts against this class of bound colonists that a runaway might be
declared outlawed, and might rightfully be killed by any <a id="person"></a>person.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup></p>


<h3><span>Treatment of the Fugitives.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;3. <a id="Treatment_of_fugitives"></a>Treatment of fugitives.</b>&mdash;From 1640 to 1700, laws were also passed in
New Jersey, Maryland, South Carolina, and Virginia. It is not necessary
to follow out the provisions <a id="he7"></a>here,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> but each of the Southern colonies,
as in later regulations, provided most minutely for all possible cases.
By a Virginia law of 1642, all persons who entertained runaways, whether
slaves or hired freemen, were to be fined twenty pounds of tobacco for
each night's hospitality. The fugitives were to add to their tenure of
service double their time of absence, and on a second offence to be
branded with the letter <a id="R8"></a>R.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup></p>


<p>A curious regulation in 1660-1, in Virginia, provided that if a negro and
white bound servant ran away together, since the negro's time of
servitude was for life, and he was therefore incapable of making up his
lost time, the white servant's punishment should be doubled by adding the
negro's sentence to his o<a id="wn9"></a>wn.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> Another regulation, entitled "How to Know
a Runaway," commanded that all recovered fugitives have their hair "cutt"
close about their ea<a id="rs10"></a>rs.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup></p>

<p>Sometimes the penalties were even more severe, but the processes were
much the same. A person who found a slave or vagabond without a pass
usually took him before the next justice, who took cognizance of the
captor's good service, and certified it in the next Assembly: the runaway
was then delivered from constable to constable, until he was returned to
his master.</p>

<p>After 1700 the process grows yet more elaborate; for example, take a
North Carolina law of 1741. The securer of a runaway was to have seven
shillings and sixpence proclamation money, and for every mile over ten
which he conducted the fugitive threepence extra. When seized, runaways
were to be whipped and placed in the county gaol. If the owner
was known, he was notified and went for his slave; if not, a notice
describing the runaway must be placed upon the door of the court-house,
and sent to the clerk or reader of each church or chapel within the
county. They were required to post all such notices every Lord's day for
two months in some convenient place near the church. At the end of this
time, should no claimant appear, the slave must be sent from constable to
constable, till the public gaol of the government was reached. There,
upon consent of the court or of two justices, he might be sold to hire by
the gaol<a id="er11"></a>er.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup> The Maryland
 Archives record that in 1669 ten thousand
pounds of tobacco were appropriated to build one of these log-house gaols
wherein fugitive servants might be lodg<a id="ed12"></a>ed.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;4. <a id="Regulations_in_New_England"></a>Regulations in New England colonies.</b>&mdash;Let us turn now to the New
England colonies. Here we must expect to find but few provisions, since
the class of slaves and bound servants was so small that it could easily
be controlled. The first law in Massachusetts Bay was passed in 1630, and
was entitled, "An Act respecting Masters, Servants, and Laborers." In
accordance with the arbitrary methods of government then pursued, it
included not only runaway servants, but also any persons who should
"privily go away with suspicion of evil intention," and ordered the
magistrate "to press men, boats, or pinnaces," and "to bring them back by
force of arms." A humane provision, usually wanting in Southern laws,
though also found in New Netherlands, declared that, whenever servants
fled on account of the tyranny of their masters, they should be protected
until measures for their relief could be <a id="taken13"></a>taken.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup></p>

<p>In Connecticut and New Hampshire similar laws were passed, and in 1707
Massachusetts Bay, in regulating the free negro population, enacted that
every freeman or mulatto who should harbor a negro servant in his house
without his owner's consent should pay five shillings for the use of the
poor of the <a id="town14"></a>town.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup></p>

<p>In those days, when bridges were few, the ferrymen were apparently much
relied upon as agents to detect and apprehend runaways. In 1714 we find
that several negro slaves had been carried over ferries, and thus escaped
out of Rhode Island. The Assembly therefore enacted that "no ferryman or
boatman whatsoever, within this colony, shall carry or bring any
slave as aforesaid over their ferries, without a certificate under the
hands of their masters or mistresses, or some person in authority, upon
the penalty of paying all costs and damages their said masters or
mistresses shall sustain thereby: and to pay a fine of twenty shillings
for the use of the colony for each offence, as aforesaid." All persons
were also commanded to take up any slave they might find travelling about
without a <a id="pass15"></a>pass.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Escapes in New England.</span></h3>


<p><b>§&nbsp;5. <a id="Escapes_in_New_England"></a>Escapes in New England: Attucks case.</b>&mdash;Although we do not find
records of fugitive slave cases tried at this time within the New England
colonies, advertisements of runaways exist in sufficient numbers to prove
that escapes were common. It seems probable, therefore, that the return
of a slave when within his own colony was taken as a matter of course,
and roused so little opposition, and required so simple a process at law,
that matters concerning it would seldom find mention in the chronicles of
the time. Here is a typical advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
 <p>   "Ran away from Samuel Gilbert of Littleton, an indentured Servant
    Boy, named Samuel Gilson, about 17&nbsp;years old, of a middling Stature
    for his Age, and wears black curled Hair, he carried away with him a
    blue cloth Coat, a light colored Jacket with sleeves, one pair of
    worsted Stockings, two striped woolen Shirts, and one good linnen
    Shirt. He went away in company with a short thick set Fellow, who
    wore a green coat and a green Jacket double breasted, also a pair
    Indian green Stockings. Whoever shall take up and secure, or give
    information of said runaway, so that his master may find him again,
    shall receive a Reward of two dollars and all necessary charges from</p>
<p class="ralign5">     <span class="smcap">Samuel Gilbert.</span></p>
<p> "All masters of vessels and others are cautioned against harboring,"
    <a id="etc16"></a>etc.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup></p></div>



<p>Again a case interesting not only as an illustration of the customs of
the time, but also because the fugitive himself bears a name known to
history in another connection, is noticed in the Boston Gazette of 1750.
Here is advertised as escaping, October 2, 1750, from his master, William
Browne of Framingham, Massachusetts, "A molatto fellow about twenty-seven
years of age, named Crispus." After describing his clothing and
appearance, a reward of ten pounds, old tenor, is offered for his return,
and "all masters of vessels and others are cautioned against concealing said servant on penalty of <a id="law17"></a>law."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup> Tradition has it,
however, that he was never arrested, but returned of his own accord after
a short time, and was for the next twenty years a faithful s<a id="erv18"></a>ervant.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup>
Then, in 1770, presumably while in town upon one of the expeditions he
often undertook to buy and sell cattle for his master, he was drawn into
the Boston Massacre of Ma<a id="rch19"></a>rch 5.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup></p>


<p>A somewhat famous case, which also occurred in Massachusetts, though many
years later, may here be mentioned. About 1769 one Rotch, a Quaker, and
therefore probably opposed to slavery, received on board the whaler
Friendship a young negro boy named Boston, belonging to the heirs of
William Swain. At the end of the voyage his master, John Swain, brought
action in the court of Nantucket against Captain Folger for the recovery
of the slave; the jury, whether from lack of evidence or from sympathy
cannot be determined, returned a verdict in favor of the d<a id="efenda20"></a>efendant.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Dutch and Intercolonial Regulations.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;6. <a id="Dutch_regulations_in_New"></a>Dutch regulations in New Netherlands.</b>&mdash;The early New Netherlands
regulations furnish many interesting provisions concerning fugitive
servants. Apparently the servile class was numerous, and hard to govern.
In the words of the ordinance of 1640, "many servants daily run away from
their masters, whereby the latter are put to great inconvenience and
expense; the corn and tobacco rot in the field, and the whole harvest is
at a standstill, which tends to the serious injury of this country, to
their masters' ruin, and to bring the magistracy into contempt." It was
therefore ordained that runaways must, at the end of their term of
indenture, serve double the time of their absence, and make good all loss
and damage to their masters; while persons harboring fugitives were
obliged to pay a fine of fifty <a id="guilders21"></a>guilders.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;7. <a id="Escapes_from_New_Amsterdam"></a>Escapes from New Amsterdam.</b>&mdash;Within these Dutch colonies there is
recorded a case of escape as early as 1659. Four menservants of Cornelis
Herperts de Jager, of New Amsterdam, ran away to Manhattan. One of them
soon returned, and in accordance with the regulation made in 1630 by the
West India <a id="Company22"></a>Company,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup> requiring the return of fugitives in
their various settlements, one of the officers of the colony sent to
Manhattan an order to arrest and bring back the remaining three in
<a id="chains23"></a>chains.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup></p>


<p><b>§&nbsp;8. Intercoloni<a id="al"></a>al regulations.</b>&mdash;It will be seen that most of the
colonies considered some provision against runaways necessary to the
welfare of the settlements. To secure such legislation in a single colony
was a comparatively easy matter; but the unorganized and sparsely settled
condition of the country rendered any intercolonial regulations
difficult.</p>

<p>The first formal agreement of this kind was arranged by the New England
Confederation of Plymouth, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Haven, in
1643. In their Articles of Confederation was a clause which promised: "If
any servant runn away from his master into any other of these
confederated Jurisdiccons, That in such Case vpon the Certyficate of one
Majistrate in the Jurisdiccon out of which the said servant fled, or upon
other due proofe, the said servant shall be deliuered either to his
Master or any other that pursues and brings such Certificate <a id="or24"></a>or
<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup> This clause contains the earliest statement of the
principles regarding the treatment of fugitive slave cases, afterward
carried out in the United States statutes of 1787, 1793, and 1850. There
was no trial by jury, but the certificate of a magistrate was sufficient
evidence to convict the runaway.</p>


<p>It is probable, also, that the rendition of fugitives was considered a
duty incumbent upon all colonies, whatever their relation to each other,
since about this time we find an agreement made for the mutual surrender
of fugitives between the Dutch at New Netherlands and the English at New
<a id="Haven25"></a>Haven.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup></p>

<p>Not only did the slaves of the Dutch escape to the English colonies, but
they often fled to the forests, where recovery must have been almost
impossible unless the Indians could be induced to hunt them out. Curious
rewards were sometimes offered. Maryland, in 1669, ordered that any
Indian who shall apprehend a fugitive may have a "match coate," or its
<a id="value26"></a>value.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup> Virginia would give "20 armes length of Roanoke," or
its <a id="value27"></a>value,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup> while in Connecticut "two yards of cloth" was considered
sufficient <a id="inducement28"></a>inducement.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup></p>

<p>We have record of several conferences upon this subject. Governor Burnett
of New York asked his Indians to exert themselves in behalf of the
Governor of Virginia, who had written to him about the escape of several
of his negro servants to the mountains. The Indians promised their help
in this and any other search; but as they seldom seem to have succeeded,
it is probable that their sympathy was with the <a id="fugitives29"></a>fugitives.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup> Again
Governor Burnett demanded the restoration of a certain Indian slave whom
they had kidnapped from the English. The Indians acknowledged the fact,
but they said that he was then sold to others, and nothing further could
be <a id="done30"></a>done.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn30">30</a></sup></p>

<p>Canada even in these early times seems also to have been a haven for
fugitives. In 1705 New York passed an act, which was renewed in 1715, to
prevent slaves running away from frontier towns like Albany to Canada,
because it was of great importance, they said, in time of war, "that no
Intelligence be carried from the said city and county to the French in
<a id="Canada31"></a>Canada."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup></p>

<p>During all this time the Southern colonies, especially the Carolinas and
Georgia, were also making many complaints in regard to the difficulty
they had in recovering the fugitives, both Indian and negro, who were
escaping in large numbers into Florida. There, among the Creek Indians
and the Spanish at St. Augustine, they easily found <a id="refuge32"></a>refuge.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn32">32</a></sup> This
difficulty was, however, not remedied in colonial times, but continued
long after the formation of the Federal Union, and in fact until the
close of the Seminole war, in 1845.</p>



<h3><span>Intercolonial Cases.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;9. <a id="Intercolonial_cases"></a>Intercolonial cases.</b>&mdash;When, as was often the case, no agreement upon
the return of fugitives had been arranged between the colonies, the
rendition of a slave depended wholly upon the state of feeling existing
between the two peoples, and sometimes became an important question.
Between the New England colonies no cases have been found recorded,
although we infer that there must have been reason for the
insertion of a fugitive slave clause in the Articles of Confederation<a id="of33"></a> of
1643.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn33">33</a></sup></p>

<p>Of other early cases one of the most interesting is the escape from
Virginia of four Englishmen belonging to the class of bound servants.
They rowed in a small boat up the coast as far as Cape May, where they
<a id="landed34"></a>landed.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn34">34</a></sup> They soon found themselves objects of suspicion with the
people, and, as was a common practice, took refuge among the Indians.
About a year afterward their masters tracked them to their place of
refuge, and captured two of them, but the others were again beyond reach.
The Indians, who evidently did not always befriend runaways, had just
sold one of them, William Browne, to a Swede, and Browne, learning of his
former master's appearance, had found opportunity to escape. The fourth
of the fugitives was still among the Mantas, and could not be secured. Of
the two recaptured, one was returned without trouble, but the other,
Turc, who had just entered the service of a certain Pieter Aldrich,
resisted his captors. A struggle took place upon the boat in which they
were carrying him away. After wounding three of his guards, he succeeded
in making his escape, only to be recaptured almost immediately. When
tried for the deed at New Amsterdam, he received a death <a id="sentence35"></a>sentence.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn35">35</a></sup> In
this case, one of the most complete in detail left to us, may be found,
in the incidents of escape, pursuit, resistance, and final rendition, all
the features of the later fugitive slave cases. It is also an example
wherein the laws of the period, which required the rendition of a bound
white man in the same manner as a negro slave, were strictly carried out:
and in the diverse fates of the four men we find instances probably
typical of the fortunes of most fugitives of the time.</p>


<p><b>§&nbsp;10. I<a id="nter"></a>nternational relations.</b>&mdash;The proximity of the French, Spanish, and
Dutch settlements led to escapes from the colonies of one power into
those of another. All were slaveholding communities, and there was no
disposition to shield a slave because his lot was a hard one; but the
distrust and enmity between neighboring colonies owing allegiance to
different sovereigns caused such escapes to lead to petty quarrels. There
was no system of extradition treaties; in fact, there was as yet little
international law. Fugitives were demanded as an act of comity,
and sometimes their delivery was refused. It was hardly a subject on
which the home governments bestirred themselves. The colonies were left
to make their own agreements, or to settle their own disagreements.</p>

<h3><span>International Cases.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;11. <a id="International_cases"></a>International cases.</b>&mdash;Thus far only those cases have been noticed
which arose within and between colonies of the same nation. Let us now
consider a very early case of disagreement between colonies of different
nations, which occurred in 1646. The commissioners of the United Colonies
made complaint to the Governor of New Netherlands that his Dutch agent at
Hartford was harboring one of their Indian slaves. Soon after, Governor
Stuyvesant was refused the return of some of his runaway servants from
New Haven. Thereupon the angry Lords of the West India Company issued a
proclamation commanding that there should be no rendition of fugitive
slaves to New Haven. This provision continued in effect until Governor
Elton sent back some of the fugitives to New Netherlands. It was then
annulled, and a mutual agreement to return the runaways was entered into
by the United Colonies and the <a id="Dutch36"></a>Dutch.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn36">36</a></sup> Governor John Winthrop, in his
History of New England, refers to the case, and says that Massachusetts
Bay endeavored to bring about a reconciliation, and wrote to the Governor
of New Netherlands intimating to him that "at their request he might send
back the fugitives without prejudice to their right or <a id="reputation37"></a>reputation."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn37">37</a></sup></p>

<p>Maryland also found difficulty, from the readiness with which her
servants could flee north to New Netherlands. In the State Archives may
be found a letter sent by the authorities to the Governor of New
Netherlands, as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p> "<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Some servants being lately fledd out of this colony, into
   yours, as is supposed, we could not promise ourselves from you that
   justice &amp; faire correspondence betweene the two governments so neerly
   bordering &amp; which are shortly like to be nearer neighbors in delaware
   bay, as to hope that vpon the receiving of these Outres &amp; the demand
   of the parties interessted you will remand to us all such apprentice
   servants as are or shall run out of this government into yours; and
   will compell such other persons, as shall flie to you without a passe,
   being indebted or otherwise obnoxious to the justice of this
   place, to make such satisfaction to the parties endamaged by their
   unlawful departure, upon their complaints and proofe thereof, as you
   shall find justice to require. And you may promise yourself the like
   helpe and concurrence from this governm't in that or any other thing
   as shalbe in the power of it: And so we bid you heartilly farewell&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;rest.</p>

 <p>  "To the hon'ble the Governor of the New <a id="Netherlands38"></a>Netherlands."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn38">38</a></sup></p>
</div>


<p>In 1659 the Dutch had occasion to ask the same favor of Maryland. Whether
there had been trouble between the colonies since the earlier letter we
do not know, but the spirit of the communication was quite different.
Instead of assurances of good will, and expressions of a belief in the
certainty of peaceful return, the Dutch threatened, if their servants
were not secured to them, "to publish free liberty, access and recess to
all planters, servants, negroes, fugitives, and runaways which may go
into New <a id="Netherland39"></a>Netherland."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn39">39</a></sup></p>

<p>Trouble was also constantly arising between the French and English, or
French and Dutch, in regard to the many runaways who fled from the
Eastern colonies northward to Canada. In 1750 there was a dispute about a
certain negro belonging to the English, but at that time in possession of
the Sieur de la Corne St. Luc; and, in a letter to a friend, one of the
officers of the colony makes the following explanation concerning them:
"In regard to the negro in possession of Sieur de la Corne St. Luc I
thought proper not to send him back every negro being a slave wherever he
be. Besides, I am only doing what the English did in 1747. Ensign de
Malbronne on board Le Screux had a negro servant who was at first taken
from him; I took pains to reclaim him, but the English refused to
surrender him on ground as <a id="above40"></a>above."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn40">40</a></sup></p>


<p><b>§&nbsp;12. Relations with the <a id="mother_country"></a>mother country.</b>&mdash;With only one country across
the sea was any question of fugitives likely to arise. In England white
slavery had long since died out, except as a punishment for crime;
villeinage ceased about the time the colonies were settled. But the
status of black slaves who were taken from the colonies to England was in
practice unchanged.</p>

<p>The principle thus apparently established by custom was overthrown by a
succession of legal decisions, culminating in the famous
Somersett Case. It was first decided by Thomas Grahame, judge in the
Admiralty Court, Glasgow, that a certain negro who had been brought into
Great Britain must be liberated, on the ground that a guiltless human
being taken into that country must be <a id="free41"></a>free.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn41">41</a></sup> In 1762 occurred another
similar case. A bill had been filed in equity by an administrator to
recover money given by his intestate to a negro brought to England as a
slave. The suit was dismissed by Lord Northington, who said that as soon
as a man set foot on English ground he was <a id="free42"></a>free.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn42">42</a></sup></p>

<p>The Somersett case came ten years later. The circumstances were as
follows. A Mr. Stewart, accompanied by his slave Somersett, left Boston
on the 1st of October, 1769, and went to London, where he kept his slave
until October 1, 1771. Then Somersett ran away, but his owner soon
secured him and had him placed on board a vessel bound for Jamaica,
probably with the intention of selling him as a slave. A writ of habeas
corpus was then served upon the captain of the ship, and on the hearing
Lord Mansfield decided that Somersett must be discharged. In England, he
said, slavery could exist only by positive law; and in default of such
law there was no legal machinery for depriving a man of his liberty on
the ground that he was a slave. The importance of the case for the
colonies lay not in the assertion of the principle that slavery depended
on positive law, for the American statute-books were full of positive law
on slavery; the precedent thus established determined the future course
of England against the delivery of fugitives, whether from her colonies
or from other <a id="countries43"></a>countries.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn43">43</a></sup></p>


<p><b>§&nbsp;13. Intern<a id="atio"></a>ational regulations under the Articles of Confederation
(1781-1788).</b>&mdash;When, on March 1, 1781, the Articles of Confederation went
into effect, the only action taken by the United States on the subject of
fugitives had been the negotiation of a treaty with the Delaware Indians,
August 7, 1778, by which the parties bound themselves not "to protect in
their respective States criminal fugitives, servants, or slaves, but the
same to apprehend, secure, and <a id="deliver44"></a>deliver."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn44">44</a></sup> In seven of the
eight other treaties negotiated with Indian tribes from 1784 to 1786,
clauses were introduced for the return of black prisoners, or of "negroes
and other <a id="property45"></a>property."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn45">45</a></sup> The States affected were chiefly Southern; but
the article on the same subject in the Treaty of Peace in 1782 and 1783,
was intended as much to protect the slaveholders of New York as those of
Virginia. It was distinctly agreed that the British should not carry away
"any negroes or other <a id="property46"></a>property."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn46">46</a></sup> The failure to abide by this
agreement led to reclamation by the American government, but no indemnity
was ever <a id="secured47"></a>secured.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn47">47</a></sup></p>



<h3><span>English Law. Northwest Ordinance.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;14. <a id="Ordinance_for_the_Northwest"></a>Ordinance for the Northwest Territory.</b>&mdash;Since all the thirteen
colonies recognized slavery, the Revolution made no difference in any
previous intercolonial practice as to the delivery of slaves; in framing
the Articles of Confederation no clause on the subject was thought
necessary. The precedent of the New England Confederation was forgotten
or ignored. But the action of the States of Vermont, Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, in taking steps toward
immediate or gradual emancipation, from 1777 to 1784, brought up a new
question,&mdash;the status of fugitives in free regions. Before the change of
conditions in the States was completely understood, the same question had
arisen in the Western territories. Jefferson, in 1784, proposed to draw a
north and south line through the mouth of the Kanawha, west of which
there should be no slavery <a id="after48"></a>after 1800.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn48">48</a></sup> The next year a Northern man
proposed a similar limitation in the territory north of the Ohio, and
added a clause for the return of fugitive slaves to the original slave
<a id="States49"></a>States.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn49">49</a></sup> Neither of these two propositions was carried, but the
principles both of exclusion of slavery and of the return of fugitives
appear in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the first legislation by
Congress looking toward the surrender of fugitives by any Territory or
State. In providing a government for the new Territory, it was enacted,
July 13, 1787, that "any person escaping into the same from whom labor or
service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original States, such
fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed, and conveyed to the person
claiming his or her labor or service as <a id="aforesaid50"></a>aforesaid."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn50">50</a></sup> The fugitive
clause seems to have provoked no discussion, but to have been accepted as
a reasonable condition of the limitation of slavery.</p>



<h3><span>Fugitive Question in Constitutional Conventions.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;15. The Fu<a id="giti"></a>gitive question in the Constitutional Conventions.</b>&mdash;While the
Northwest Ordinance was passing through Congress, the Philadelphia
Convention was framing a new Constitution, and the return of fugitives
was again eagerly insisted upon by the slave States. The necessity of
some positive stipulation that fugitives should be returned was felt to
be even more necessary in a Constitution meant permanently to bind
together a free and a slaveholding section. The only debate of which we
have a record occurred August 28, 1787. Mr. Butler of North Carolina
pressed the point in behalf of the Southern States. To his first
proposition, "that fugitive slaves and servants be delivered up like
<a id="criminals51"></a>criminals,"<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn51">51</a></sup> Mr. Wilson objected; he saw no reason for obliging the
state to arrest fugitives at public expense, while Mr. Sherman saw no
more propriety in the public seizing and surrendering a slave or servant
than a <a id="horse52"></a>horse.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn52">52</a></sup> Mr. Butler therefore withdrew the proposition. He soon
introduced a more particular provision, which was accepted and inserted
in the Constitution, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">"No person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws
thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or
Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall
be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may
be <a id="due53"></a>due."</span><sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn53">53</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p>In the various Constitutional Conventions, there was little discussion
upon the matter. The Southern States in general considered the clause
sufficient to protect their property. General Charles C. Pinckney, in
South Carolina, said: "We have obtained the right to recover our slaves
in whatever part of America they may take refuge, which is a right we
have not had before. In short, considering all circumstances, we have
made the best terms for the security of this species of property it was
in our power to make. We would have made better if we could, but on the
whole I do not think them <a id="bad54"></a>bad."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn54">54</a></sup>
 In North Carolina, Mr.
Iredell explained to the Convention that the Northern delegates, owing to
their peculiar scruples on the subject of slavery, did not choose the
word "slave" to be mentioned; but since the present laws were so
prejudicial to the inhabitants of the Southern States, some such clause
was <a id="necessary55"></a>necessary.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn55">55</a></sup> In Virginia, Mr. Grayson discussed the provision
giving Congress exclusive legislation over ten square miles surrounding
the capital. It seemed to him that, unless the ten miles square be
considered a State, "persons bound to labor who shall escape thereto will
not be given up. For they are only to be delivered up after they shall
have escaped into a <a id="State56"></a>State."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn56">56</a></sup> This objection, though perfectly good at
the time, was later overcome by the adoption by Congress of the laws of
Maryland for the regulation of the District of Columbia, whereby it was
made slave territory. Mr. Mason did not think the clause provided
sufficiently for the protection of their <a id="slaves57"></a>slaves,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn57">57</a></sup> but Mr. Madison
urged its adoption, as a better security than anything they then <a id="had58"></a>had.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn58">58</a></sup></p>

<p>In the North, there was apparently no discussion upon this article.
Everywhere, however, it was thought that without such a clause the
Southern States would not consent to the Union, and, in a spirit of
compromise, the provision was accepted.</p>

</div>
<p><b>§&nbsp;16. <a id="Effe"></a>Effect of the fugitive slave clause in the Constitution.</b>&mdash;By
obtaining in the Constitution the insertion of a clause requiring the
return of fugitives, a great step for the advancement of the interests of
slavery had been taken. For this embodiment in the Constitution ever
afterward formed a basis for the slaveholder's argument that the
Constitution recognized and defended slavery, and was a justification to
Northern men in their support of the later fugitive slave laws.</p>

<p>Although the clause did not in terms apply to the Territories, the
Ordinance of 1787 was, on August 7, 1789, confirmed in terms which by
implication continued the sixth article, including the rendition of
<a id="slaves59"></a>slaves;<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn59">59</a></sup> and in the earliest treaties made by the United States with
Indian tribes, under the new Constitution, the return of negroes was
expressly <a id="required60"></a>required.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn60">60</a></sup></p>





<h3><span>The First Fugitive Slave Act.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;17. <a id="The_first"></a>The first Fugitive Slave Act (1793).</b>&mdash;For some time, however, the
provision of the Constitution remained unexecuted; and it is a
striking fact that the call for legislation came not from the South, but
from a free State; and that it was provoked, not by fugitive slaves, but
by kidnappers. The case seemed to suggest that an act of Congress was
necessary, more definite in conditions and detail than the provision of
the Constitution.</p>

<p>A free negro named John was seized at Washington, Pennsylvania, in 1791,
and taken to Virginia. The Governor of Pennsylvania, at the instigation
of the Society for the Abolition of Slavery, asked the return of the
three kidnappers; but the Governor of Virginia replied that, since there
was no national law touching such a case, he could not carry out the
<a id="request61"></a>request.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn61">61</a></sup></p>

<p>On the matter being brought to the notice of Congress by the Governor of
<a id="Pennsylvania62"></a>Pennsylvania,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn62">62</a></sup> a Committee, consisting of Mr. Sedgwick, Mr. Bourne of
Massachusetts, and Mr. White, was appointed in the House of
Representatives to bring in a bill or bills "providing the means by which
persons charged in any State with treason, felony, or other crime, who
shall flee from justice, shall, on the demand of the executive authority
of the State from which they fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the
State having jurisdiction of the crime; also providing the mode by which
a person held to service or labor in one State under the laws thereof,
escaping into another, shall be delivered up on the claim of the party to
whom such service or labor may be <a id="due63"></a>due."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn63">63</a></sup></p>

<p>A bill prepared by the House committee, of which Mr. Sedgwick was
chairman, was reported, <a id="November64"></a>November 15, 1791;<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn64">64</a></sup> but for some reason which
does not appear, it was dropped, and a Senate committee, of which Calvert
was chairman, was appointed, March 30, 1792, "to consider the expediency
[of] a bill respecting fugitives from justice and from the service of
their <a id="masters65"></a>masters."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn65">65</a></sup> Nothing was done during this session, and, November
22, 1792, a second Senate committee was appointed, consisting of
Johnston, Calvert, and <a id="Read66"></a>Read,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn66">66</a></sup> and they submitted
 a bill, <a id="December67"></a>December 20, 1792.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn67">67</a></sup> Unfortunately, we have no details of the debate; but on
December 28, a third Senate committee was appointed by adding
Taylor and Sherman to the committee of November 22, and to them the bill
was recommitted with instructions to <a id="amend68"></a>amend.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn68">68</a></sup> At last, January 3, 1793,
the bill was reported in a form not unlike that finally agreed <a id="upon69"></a>upon.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn69">69</a></sup>
Of the amendments offered, the text of only one is preserved in the
Journals; it was for the insertion of a less sum than five hundred
dollars as the penalty for harboring a fugitive, or resisting his
<a id="arrest70"></a>arrest.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn70">70</a></sup> It was not adopted. After two debates, of which we have no
record, the bill passed the Senate, <a id="January71"></a>January 18.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn71">71</a></sup> In the House it seems
to have elicited little discussion, and it passed, February 5, by a vote
of 48 <a id="to72"></a>to 7.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn72">72</a></sup> The bill became law by the signature of the President,
<a id="February73"></a>February 12, 1793.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn73">73</a></sup></p>

<p>In thus uniting with the clause providing for the extradition of
fugitives from justice one requiring the return of fugitive slaves,
Congress was but following examples set in 1643 by the Articles of
<a id="Confederation74"></a>Confederation,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn74">74</a></sup> and again
 in 1787 by the <a id="Constitution75"></a>Constitution.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn75">75</a></sup> From the
scanty records, it is possible to discern only that there was serious
difference of opinion in the Senate, and that the measure finally adopted
was probably a compromise. In the one amendment stated, there is a faint
protest against the harshness of the <a id="law76"></a>law.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn76">76</a></sup></p>


<p><b>§&nbsp;18. <a id="Disc"></a>Discussion of the first act.</b>&mdash;The provisions of the act of 1793 are
quoted <a id="elsewhere77"></a>elsewhere;<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn77">77</a></sup> their purport was as follows. The act provided at
the same time for the recovery of fugitives from justice and from labor;
but the alleged criminal was to have a protection through the requirement
of a requisition, a protection denied to the man on trial for his liberty
only. The act was applicable to fugitive apprentices as well as to
slaves, a provision of some importance at the time. In the Northwest
Territory there were so-called negro apprentices, who were
virtually slaves, and to whom the law applied, since it was in terms
extended to all the Territories. Proceedings began with the forcible
seizure of the alleged fugitive.</p>

<p>The act, it will be observed, does not admit a trial by jury. It allowed
the owner of the slave, his agent or attorney, to seize the fugitive and
take him before any judge of a United States Circuit or District Court,
or any local <a id="magistrate78"></a>magistrate.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn78">78</a></sup> The only requirement for the conviction of
the slave was the testimony of his master, or the affidavit of some
magistrate in the State from which he came, certifying that such a person
had escaped. Hindering arrest or harboring a slave was punishable by a
fine of five hundred dollars. The law thus established a system allowing
the greatest harshness to the slave and every favor to the master. Even
at that time, when persons might still be born slaves in New York and New
Jersey, and gradual emancipation had not yet taken full effect in Rhode
Island and Connecticut, it was repellent to the popular sense of justice;
there were two cases of resistance to the principle of the act before the
close <a id="of79"></a>of 1793.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn79">79</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Propositions of 1797 and 1802.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;19. <a id="Propositions_of_1797"></a>Propositions of 1797 and 1802.</b>&mdash;Until 1850 no further law upon this
subject was passed, but as the provisions of 1793 were found ineffectual,
many attempts at amendment were made. In 1796 a troublesome question
arose out of the seizure, under the act of 1793, of four negroes who had
been manumitted in North Carolina. A retroactive act of that State had
declared them slaves again, and they had fled to Philadelphia where they
were arrested. January 30, 1797, they petitioned Congress for relief, and
after an exciting debate the House by a vote of 50 to 33 refused to
receive the <a id="petition80"></a>petition.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn80">80</a></sup> There is nothing in the scanty records which
connects this case or petition with an attempt to amend the act; but it
is altogether likely that it occasioned Murray's motion of December 29,
1796, for a committee to report on alterations of the <a id="law81"></a>law;<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn81">81</a></sup> and that
it led to the almost simultaneous appointment of a House committee on
<a id="January82"></a>January 2,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn82">82</a></sup> and a Senate committee
  on <a id="January83"></a>January 3.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn83">83</a></sup> No report is
recorded.</p>

<p>The
 coming on of difficulties with France, and the Alien and
Sedition Acts of 1798, absorbed the popular attention. In 1800 debates on
the slave trade and on the reception of petitions from free negroes
began. January 22, 1801, a House committee was appointed to report a bill
increasing the stringency of the <a id="act84"></a>act.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn84">84</a></sup>
 The bill was reported, but failed to be <a id="considered85"></a>considered.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn85">85</a></sup> In the next Congress the matter was at last
brought to an issue. A committee, of which Nicholson of Maryland was
chairman, was appointed, <a id="December86"></a>December 11, 1801,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn86">86</a></sup> and reported only seven
days later. The report was made a special order for <a id="December87"></a>December 21.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn87">87</a></sup> On
that day no debate is recorded, but a petition from a free colored
soldier of the Revolution was contemptuously denied <a id="reception88"></a>reception.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn88">88</a></sup>
January 14 and 15, the bill was debated freely, and from the debate and
sundry amendments the character of the bill may be inferred. Not only
harboring, but employing a fugitive, was made punishable; and it was
ordained that every black employed must be furnished with an official
certificate, and that every person who employed a negro must publish a
description of him. Southern members "considered it a great injury to the
owners of that species of property, that runaways were employed in the
Middle and Northern States, and even assisted in procuring a living. They
stated that, when slaves ran away and were not recovered, it excited
discontent among the rest. When they were caught and brought home, they
informed their comrades how well they were received and assisted, which
excited a disposition in others to attempt escaping, and obliged their
masters to use greater severity than they otherwise would. It was, they
said, even on the score of humanity, good policy in those opposed to
slavery to agree to this <a id="law89"></a>law."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn89">89</a></sup> This appeal to the humanity of the
North failed to produce the requisite effect. On the test vote, January
18, 1802, every Southern member except two voted for the bill, every
Northern member except five against it; the vote was 43 to 46, and the
bill was laid <a id="aside90"></a>aside.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn90">90</a></sup></p>





<h3><span> Propositions from 1817 to 1822.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;20. <a id="Propositions_from_1817"></a>Propositions from 1817 to 1822.</b>&mdash;For many years the question of
amendment of the law does not appear to have come up in Congress. The
abolition of the slave trade seems to have absorbed the attention of
Congress. Several treaties were negotiated including clauses on the
return of <a id="fugitives91"></a>fugitives.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn91">91</a></sup> The question was brought up again in 1817 by
Pindall of Virginia, who for several years urged a revision of the act. A
committee of which he was chairman was appointed, December 15, 1817, and
reported a bill, <a id="December92"></a>December 29, 1817.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn92">92</a></sup> This third proposition of general
amendment led to a debate, January 26 and 29, 1818, in which for the
first time we have a record of discussion on the principles of the act
and its relations to human freedom. The opposition was based not only on
constitutional, but on humanitarian <a id="grounds93"></a>grounds.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn93">93</a></sup> A petition of the
Pennsylvania Abolition Society, asking for a milder law than that of
1793, added fuel to the <a id="discussion94"></a>discussion.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn94">94</a></sup></p>

<p>The principle of the bill was that the fugitives should be surrendered by
a requisition on the State Executive, as in the case of fugitives from
justice: the question of proof was thus left to the courts of the State
of the claimant, and there was to be no habeas corpus. The strongest
expression of disapproval is found in the speech of Mr. Adams of
Massachusetts, who said, "that, in guaranteeing the possession of slaves,
the Constitution did not authorize or require the General Government to
go as far as the bill proposed to render this bill effectual; that the
bill contained provisions dangerous to the liberty and safety of the free
people of color in other sections of the <a id="Union95"></a>Union."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn95">95</a></sup> Mr. Rich of Vermont
desired "that it might be so amended as to guard more effectually the
rights of free persons of color. This motion he enforced by urging the
oppressions to which these persons were now subjected, and the necessity
of some regulation on the subject, which he thought might be very
properly connected with this <a id="bill96"></a>bill."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn96">96</a></sup> Mr. Livermore also showed that it
exposed the colored men of the North to the peril of being dragged South,
and there <a id="convicted97"></a>convicted.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn97">97</a></sup></p>

<p>All these objections, however, were considered of little value by some
who, like Smith of Maryland, thought that the subject of the
free colored population and their protection should be treated
separately, while Mr. Holmes of Massachusetts suggested that the
operation of the writ of habeas corpus would render such acts of
injustice <a id="improbable98"></a>improbable.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn98">98</a></sup> Mason, of the same State, objected to a trial
by jury, which had been suggested, because "juries in Massachusetts would
in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred decide in favor of the fugitives,
and he did not wish his town [Boston] infected with the runaways of the
<a id="South99"></a>South."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn99">99</a></sup></p>

<p>Upon two constitutional points the opponents of the bill made a stand.
Mr. Sergeant wished to change the bill materially, by making "the judges
of the State in which ... slaves are seized the tribunal to decide the
fact of slavery, instead of the judges of the State whence the fugitives
escaped," but this was negatived by a large <a id="majority100"></a>majority.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn100">100</a></sup></p>
<p>Another objection to the bill, raised by Mr. Whitman, is noteworthy,
since some years later it was the point made most prominent in Judge
Story's decision in the Prigg <a id="Case101"></a>Case.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn101">101</a></sup> Mr. Whitman disapproved of the
provision making it a penal offence for a State officer to refuse his
assistance in executing the act. He did not believe that Congress had any
right to compel State officers to perform this duty; they could do no
more than authorize <a id="it102"></a>it.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn102">102</a></sup></p>

<p>A vote was taken, January 30, 1818, in the House, and the bill passed by
a vote of 84 <a id="to103"></a>to 69.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn103">103</a></sup> It was ordered that the title be "An Act to
provide for delivering up persons held to labor or service in any of the
States or Territories who shall escape into any other State or
Territory."</p>

<p>For the first time since 1793, amendment of the act seemed within reach.
The Senate showed itself in other questions more inclined than the House
to consider the claims of the South; but although Dagget's amendment to
strike out the elaborate provision for the return of fugitives by
executive requisition was not <a id="adopted104"></a>adopted,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn104">104</a></sup> the Senate first voted to
limit the bill to four <a id="years105"></a>years,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn105">105</a></sup> and then added other amendments. The
result was a non-concurrence with the House, and the failure of the
<a id="bill106"></a>bill,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn106">106</a></sup> March 13-16, 1818. A last attempt to take the bill up
failed, <a id="April107"></a>April 10, 1818.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn107">107</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Period of the Missouri Compromise.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;21. Period of the <a id="Missouri_Compromise"></a>Missouri Compromise (1819-1822).</b>&mdash;The loss of the
bill of 1818 seems not to have discouraged the friends of amendment of
the act of 1793. December 17, 1818, a resolution of the Maryland
legislature was laid before the House, calling for protection against the
citizens of Pennsylvania who harbored or protected <a id="fugitives108"></a>fugitives.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn108">108</a></sup> A
committee was appointed, January 15, 1819, which promptly reported next
day, but the bill was not <a id="considered109"></a>considered.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn109">109</a></sup></p>

<p>The question of fugitives came incidentally into the great debate of the
next session on the admission of Missouri. The region which sought
admission as a slave State was flanked on the east by free territory, and
was therefore peculiarly difficult to protect. A compromise, which made
Missouri a slave State, prohibited slavery in all other territory gained
from France north <a id="of110"></a>of 36° 30'.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn110">110</a></sup> In the prohibitory clause, however,
it was provided "that any persons escaping into the same from whom labor or service
 is lawfully claimed in any State or Territory of the United States, such fugitive may be
reclaimed, and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or
service as <a id="aforesaid111"></a>aforesaid."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn111">111</a></sup> During the immigration into Missouri which
now began, large numbers of slaveholders took their slaves with them, and
on the passage opportunities for escape were often found. In one
instance, at least, recorded in Ohio, the public sympathy was so strongly
with the fugitives that they were successfully protected from their
masters even in <a id="court112"></a>court.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn112">112</a></sup></p>

<p>Hardly was the ink dry on the President's signature of the Missouri
Compromise (March 15, 1820) before propositions were made in both the
House and Senate for new general fugitive slave acts. March 18, a House
committee was <a id="appointed113"></a>appointed,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn113">113</a></sup> but no report is recorded. April 3, an
inquiry was set on foot into the provisions of a Pennsylvania act
hindering the operation of the act <a id="of114"></a>of 1793,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn114">114</a></sup> and the Secretary of
State submitted a copy of the obnoxious act, April 18. On the
day of the Secretary's report a proposition in the Senate to instruct the
Judiciary Committee to report a bill was voted <a id="down115"></a>down.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn115">115</a></sup> Positive
evidence cannot be obtained, but it would seem that a continued effort
was made to take advantage of the agitation on the slavery question to
secure a new fugitive slave act, as was done in 1850.</p>

<p>One more attempt was made in 1821-22. Mr. Wright presented, December 17,
1821, a resolution of the Maryland General Assembly praying for relief
against the abettors of the fugitives in <a id="Pennsylvania116"></a>Pennsylvania.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn116">116</a></sup> He desired a
special committee, but the question was referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary, which reported a bill, <a id="January117"></a>January 14, 1822.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn117">117</a></sup> March 27 to
April 1, it was debated, but finally <a id="tabled118"></a>tabled.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn118">118</a></sup> The character of the
bill does not distinctly appear in the records.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;22. St<a id="atus"></a>atus of the question from 1823 to 1847.</b>&mdash;Although no amendment
could be procured to the act of 1793, the government of the United States
had repeatedly, by diplomatic demands and treaties, undertaken to recover
fugitives, or their value, for Southern owners. The first Indian treaty
negotiated under the Constitution, that of April 7, 1790, with the
Creeks, required the return of negroes held as prisoners of <a id="war119"></a>war.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn119">119</a></sup> A
similar clause appeared in the treaty made in 1814, at the end of the war
with the Creeks, a war which had been provoked in part by their ready
reception of <a id="fugitives120"></a>fugitives.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn120">120</a></sup> In 1832 the government went so far as to
promise to expend seven thousand dollars in paying for "slaves and other
property alleged to have been stolen" by the <a id="Seminoles121"></a>Seminoles.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn121">121</a></sup></p>

<p>With Great Britain, also, the encouragement of fugitives became a subject
for negotiation. Much bitterness had been felt at the carrying away by
the British, in 1783, of slaves who had taken refuge with <a id="them122"></a>them.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn122">122</a></sup> In
the treaty of Ghent, therefore, a strict clause forbade the carrying away
by the British of "any slaves or other private <a id="property123"></a>property."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn123">123</a></sup> A large
number of slaves had, during the war, been received on board British
vessels, and the humane but specious plea was set up by the British
government that the clause applied only to slaves received after
the date of the peace. A convention of 1818 submitted the question to the
Emperor of Russia, who in 1822 made a decision not wholly favorable to
either party; and <a id="in124"></a>in 1826,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn124">124</a></sup> by a second convention, Great Britain
agreed to pay $1,204,960. This last award was obtained by a
Pennsylvanian, Gallatin, acting under the direction of President John
Quincy Adams, a citizen of Massachusetts.</p>




<h3><span>Canada and Mexico Places of Refuge.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;23. <a id="Canada_and_Mexico_places_of_refuge"></a>Canada and Mexico places of refuge.</b>&mdash;The existence on the northern
and southwestern frontiers of regions in which slavery was practically,
if not yet legally, extinct, brought about another set of complications.
January 24, 1821, a resolution was presented in Congress from the General
Assembly of Kentucky, protesting against the kindly reception of
fugitives in Canada, and asking for negotiation with Great Britain on the
<a id="subject125"></a>subject.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn125">125</a></sup> In 1826, Mr. Clay, Secretary of State, instructed Mr.
Gallatin, United States Minister at the Court of St. James, to propose
the "mutual surrender of all persons held to service or labor under the
laws of either country who escape into the territory of the other." The
British government replied that any such agreement was impossible, and,
though a second attempt was made by the United States, it was without
<a id="success126"></a>success.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn126">126</a></sup></p>


<p>In 1841 Mr. Woodbridge submitted a resolution to the Senate requesting
the Committee on Foreign Relations to consider the expediency of entering
into an arrangement with Great Britain for the arrest of fugitive slaves
charged with crime who might escape over the northern boundary of the
United <a id="States127"></a>States.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn127">127</a></sup> No action was taken upon the resolution.</p>


<p>The North, however, was not the only region to which slaves were fleeing
at this time. Complaint was heard after 1830, that the "freedom and
equality granted blacks by the Mexican Constitution and law of 1829, was
attracting large numbers of slaves from <a id="Louisiana128"></a>Louisiana,"<sup class="topnum"><a href="#Louisiana128">128</a></sup> while in Florida
the Seminole trouble was not yet ended.</p>


<p>The last case of this kind occurred just at the outbreak of the Civil
War. A slave by the name of Anderson was found one day by Mr.
Seneca T. P. Diggs, wandering about his plantation in Howard County,
Missouri, without a pass. Mr. Diggs thereupon arrested him as a fugitive
slave. In the struggle which followed, the desperate runaway plunged a
knife into Mr. Diggs's heart. His captor dead, Anderson hastened on to
<a id="Canada129"></a>Canada.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn129">129</a></sup> There he lived a quiet and industrious life until 1860, when
the American government called upon Canada, under the extradition treaty,
to give up Anderson for punishment. He was arrested, but applied to the
Toronto court for a writ of habeas corpus, which was refused. An appeal
was immediately made to the Queen's Bench, England, which granted the
<a id="writ130"></a>writ.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn130">130</a></sup> In the trial Anderson was defended by Mr. Gerrit Smith in an
eloquent speech, which made a great impression, and was circulated all
over the United <a id="States131"></a>States.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn131">131</a></sup> The prisoner was discharged on a technical
<a id="point132"></a>point.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn132">132</a></sup></p>


<p><b>§&nbsp;24. Status of fugitives <a id="on_the_high_seas"></a>on the high seas.</b>&mdash;When in 1830 gradual
emancipation began in the British colonies, and in 1837 slavery ceased to
exist there, a new set of complications arose. American vessels carrying
slaves from one part of the United States to another were repeatedly
driven or conveyed into British ports, and the slaves were there treated
as ordinary fugitives, that is, as free men. Thus the Comet <a id="in133"></a>in 1830,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn133">133</a></sup>
and the Encomium <a id="in134"></a>in 1834,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn134">134</a></sup> were cast away on the Bahamas, and the
slaves on board could not be recovered. In 1835 the Enterprise was forced
by stress of weather to enter a port of the <a id="Bermudas135"></a>Bermudas,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn135">135</a></sup> and the
officers were not permitted by the British authorities to restrain the
persons on board.</p>

<p>In none of these three cases were the negroes restored; but in 1840 the
British government paid an indemnity for the first two cargoes, on the
ground that at the time of the wrecks slavery had not yet been completely
extinguished in the <a id="colonies136"></a>colonies.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn136">136</a></sup> No indemnity was allowed in the
Enterprise case, and the British government declared that it could assume
no responsibility in cases arising since the abolition of <a id="slavery137"></a>slavery.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn137">137</a></sup>
Elaborate resolutions introduced by Calhoun, March 4, 1840, and
passed, April 15, by a unanimous vote of the Senate, condemned the
British <a id="principle138"></a>principle.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn138">138</a></sup> But when, in the next year, the slaves on board
the American ship Creole rose and by force carried her into <a id="Nassau139"></a>Nassau,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn139">139</a></sup>
the British government refused to return them either as slaves or as
<a id="murderers140"></a>murderers.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn140">140</a></sup> Webster, as Secretary of State, strenuously urged the
surrender. In 1853, an arbitrator decided that an indemnity must be paid
to the American <a id="government141"></a>government.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn141">141</a></sup> On the other hand, when, in 1839, a
Spanish vessel, L'Amistad, in which the slaves on board had revolted and
killed their master, was brought into an American port, the Supreme Court
refused to permit their surrender, on the ground that they were free by
Spanish law, and therefore could not be tried for <a id="murder142"></a>murder.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn142">142</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Kidnapping from 1793-1850. Prigg Case.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;25. Kidn<a id="app"></a>apping from 1793 to 1850: Prigg case.</b>&mdash;Since slavery was now
extinct in the more northern States, their population contained many free
negroes. Upon them the eyes of the slave trader were often turned, as
easy prey under the law of 1793, and many cases of kidnapping occurred.
It was such instances, involving as they did the most manifest injustice
and cruelty, that first aroused the sympathies of the <a id="people143"></a>people.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn143">143</a></sup> The
border States like Pennsylvania were often the scene of these acts. The
neighboring white families first began to try to protect the negroes
settled near them, and a little later to give a helping hand to those
escaping from slavery, and at last, in the underground <a id="railroad144"></a>railroad,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn144">144</a></sup> to
complete a systematic organization for the assistance of fugitives. Cases
of kidnapping are recorded as early <a id="as145"></a>as 1808.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn145">145</a></sup> In 1832 the carrying
away of a black woman without process of law not only roused the people
of Pennsylvania, but led to a decision which took away much of the force
of the act of 1793.</p>

<p>A slave woman, Margaret Morgan, had fled from Maryland to Pennsylvania.
Five years later, in 1837, Edward Prigg, an attorney, caused her to be
arrested and sent back to her mistress without recourse either to the
national or State act on the subject. In the act he disregarded a law of
Pennsylvania, brought about in 1826 through the efforts of the
Society for the Abolition of Slavery, which forbade the carrying out of
the State of any negro with the intention of enslaving him. Accordingly,
Mr. Prigg was arrested and convicted in the county court. The Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania sustained the decision. Thence the case was taken
to the Supreme Court of the United States. There the counsel for Mr.
Prigg argued that the statute of Pennsylvania on which the indictment was
founded was unconstitutional, since it conflicted with the law of 1793.
Justice Story delivered the opinion of the court, and upon this decision
all future judgments were based. He announced that the law must be
carried out through national authorities alone; the States or State
magistrates could not be forced into <a id="action146"></a>action.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn146">146</a></sup> After this, many
States, seeing the advantage thus given them, passed laws which forbade
the officers to aid in a fugitive slave case, and also denied the use of
their jails for <a id="imprisonment147"></a>imprisonment.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn147">147</a></sup> Plainly the Prigg case showed a
growing indisposition on the part of the States to carry out the law,
however severe its provisions might be; and this disposition to evade its
obligations is still further evidenced by the cases given in the next
chapter.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;26. <a id="Nece"></a>Necessity of more stringent fugitive slave provisions.</b>&mdash;The
increasing number of <a id="rescues148"></a>rescues,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn148">148</a></sup> and the occurrence of several cases of
resistance, proved conclusively the inadequacy of the law of 1793. After
the Prigg decision the provisions made for its execution through national
powers were entirely insufficient. Underlying all these acts, the South
also could but perceive a sentiment the growth of which, unless checked
in some way, would at last permanently injure, if not destroy, their
peculiar institution.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;27. A<a id="cti"></a>ction of Congress from 1847 to 1850.</b>&mdash;From 1822 until 1848
apparently no effort was made to secure a new law. Then a petition
received in 1847 from the Legislature of Kentucky, urging the importance
of passing such laws as would enable the citizens of slaveholding States
to recover their slaves when they escaped into non-slaveholding
<a id="States149"></a>States,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn149">149</a></sup> gave rise to a bill from the Committee on the
<a id="Judiciary150"></a>Judiciary.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn150">150</a></sup> The bill provided "for the more effectual execution of the third clause of the second section of the Fourth Article
of the <a id="Constitution151"></a>Constitution."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn151">151</a></sup> It passed only to the second reading. In 1849,
Mr. Meade proposed in the House to instruct the Committee on the
Judiciary to report a fugitive slave <a id="bill152"></a>bill.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn152">152</a></sup> No report apparently was
ever made, but this was the last ineffectual proposition. In 1850, a new
law was successfully carried in both Houses.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;28. Slavery <a id="in_the_District"></a>in the District of Columbia.</b>&mdash;During this period, from 1840
to 1850, the subject of slavery and fugitives in the District of Columbia
began to occasion debate, which was never long silenced. It was notorious
that almost under the windows of the Capitol negroes were confined in
public jails on the ground that they were fugitives; and that a free
negro so confined might be sold for his jail fees. Resolutions for an
investigation of the condition of the jails were offered in 1848 by Mr.
<a id="Giddings153"></a>Giddings;<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn153">153</a></sup> and Mr. Hall also introduced more sweeping propositions to
repeal all laws of Congress and of Maryland which authorized or required
courts, officers, or magistrates to issue process for arrest or
commitment to the jail of the District of any fugitive <a id="slave154"></a>slave.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn154">154</a></sup>
Congress, however, was in a mood too conciliatory toward the South to
consider these propositions; and no action was taken.</p>



<h3><span>The Second Fugitive Slave Act.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;29. The second Fugitive Slave <a id="Act_1850"></a>Act (1850).</b>&mdash;In the early part of the
first session of the Thirty-first Congress, Mr. Mason of Virginia
introduced a bill to make the provisions of the fugitive slave act more
<a id="severe155"></a>severe,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn155">155</a></sup> and the bill was reported from the Committee on the
Judiciary, January 16, 1850. Two additional amendments were soon offered
by Mr. Mason. The first imposed a fine of one thousand dollars and
imprisonment for twelve months upon any one who should obstruct the
execution of the law. The second provided that the testimony of a
fugitive should not be admitted. Mr. Seward, in opposition, proposed on
the 28th to allow a fugitive the right of trial by jury, with a fine of
five thousand dollars and the forfeiture of office should the
right be disallowed by any judge or <a id="marshal156"></a>marshal.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn156">156</a></sup></p>

<p>Mr. Clay's "Omnibus Bill," by which he intended to settle the territorial
question then before Congress, and at the same time to check the
antislavery movement, contained a fugitive slave clause, though not so
severe in its provisions as Mr. <a id="Mason157"></a>Mason's.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn157">157</a></sup> This bill, however, was not
debated as a whole, but each proposition considered separately, and thus
Mr. Mason's bill became the basis of the fugitive slave provision in the
Compromise of 1850.</p>

<p>The measure was considered, and various amendments were offered, until
August 26, 1850, when it was passed by the Senate, and a few days later
by the <a id="House158"></a>House;<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn158">158</a></sup> the signature of President Fillmore was readily
appended, and it became law, <a id="September159"></a>September 18, 1850.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn159">159</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;30. <a id="Provisions_of_the_second"></a>Provisions of the second Fugitive Slave Act.</b>&mdash;Every provision of
the act was arranged for the protection and benefit of the slaveholders.
It was based upon the law of 1793, but a number of new regulations were
<a id="added160"></a>added.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn160">160</a></sup> Commissioners were to be chosen by the Circuit Courts of the
United States and the Superior Courts of the Territories, to act with the
judges of those courts in fugitive slave cases. Such commissioners could
be fined one thousand dollars for refusing to issue a writ, and were
liable for the value of any slave escaping from them. The testimony
required for rendition was the official declaration of the fact
of the escape of a slave by two witnesses, and the establishment of his
identity by oath. The testimony of the accused could not be admitted. The
right of trial by jury was not affirmed, and was therefore practically
denied. A sheriff might call upon any bystander for help in executing the
law, and the penalty for harboring or aiding in a rescue was increased
from five hundred dollars, as in 1793, to one thousand dollars, and
imprisonment for not more than six months. Should the slave escape,
damages to the same amount were to be paid to the claimant. If a mob were
feared, military force might be employed; and by a discrimination little
likely to win respect for the act, the fee of the commissioner was to be
increased from five to ten dollars whenever the case was decided in favor
of the claimant.</p>




<h3><span>Arguments for the Bill.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;31. Argumen<a id="ts_fo"></a>ts for the bill.</b>&mdash;The debate on the Fugitive Slave Bill more
than any other part of the Compromise illustrates the character of the
slavery conflict. Most of the Southern members urged the immediate
necessity of a new law, but some of the more ardent considered the evil
to be one which could be reached only through a change in public
sentiment, and they thought all legislation <a id="valueless161"></a>valueless.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn161">161</a></sup> Mr. Mason
thus presented the evils with which the law must cope. He stated that the
border States had found it an impossibility to reclaim a fugitive when he
once got within the boundaries of a non-slaveholding State; "and this
bill, or rather the amendments, ... have been framed with a great deal of
consideration, to reach, if practicable, the evils which this experience
has demonstrated to exist, and to furnish the appropriate remedy in
enabling the owner of a fugitive to reclaim him." Under the existing
laws, "you may as well go down into the sea and endeavor to recover from
his native element a fish which has escaped from you, as expect to
recover such a fugitive. Every difficulty is thrown in your way by the
population.... There are armed mobs, rescues. This is the real state of
<a id="things162"></a>things."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn162">162</a></sup></p>

<p>Not only were the laws thus set aside by individuals, but also through
the Underground Railroad an organized system of depredation was carried
on, whereby thousands of dollars were every year lost to the
<a id="slaveholder163"></a>slaveholder.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn163">163</a></sup> As an illustration of the extent to which this
disregard of law was carried, Mr. Yulee, one of the most extreme of the
Southern men, instanced a convention which was then in session in New
York "for the very purpose, openly avowed, of congratulation upon their
successful violation of the Constitution in respect to fugitives, and to
devise ways and means to encourage the escape of <a id="slaves164"></a>slaves."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn164">164</a></sup></p>

<p>Such, according to the Southern Congressmen, was the condition of
affairs. They then proceeded to contrast it with the situation as
contemplated by the Constitution, and supported by the decision of the
Supreme Court in the Prigg case. Mr. Butler insisted that this bill
required "nothing more than is enjoined by the Constitution, and which
contains the bond of union and the security of harmony; and in the name
of Washington, I would invoke all parties to observe, maintain, and
defend it." He said it was the handiwork of sages and patriots, and
resulted from intelligent concessions, for the benefit of <a id="all165"></a>all.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn165">165</a></sup> Many
speeches were filled with prophecies, more or less openly expressed, of
the dissolution of the Union. Mr. Soulé said the South must fight for its
rights, since it is the weaker of the two <a id="sections166"></a>sections.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn166">166</a></sup> It had come down
to the question, How could the Union be <a id="preserved167"></a>preserved?<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn167">167</a></sup> Some concessions
must be made. Mr. Badger urged the bill, because it "will give assurance,
it will satisfy the public mind that the Government is disposed, is truly
anxious, to accomplish the restitution of fugitive slaves; sincerely
wished and is resolved to do right to the uttermost of its power. The
proof of this will be complete, because we furnish the best means for the
recovery of the slave himself, and if these fail we can secure prompt and
adequate indemnity for the <a id="loss168"></a>loss."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn168">168</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Arguments against the Bill.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;32. Argumen<a id="ts_ag"></a>ts against the bill.</b>&mdash;On the Northern side, there seems to
have been an admission that some bill of the kind was necessary for the
interests of the Union. The opposition dwelt chiefly, therefore, upon the
details of the measure. Many considered them unjust, as recognizing only
one class of rights, those of the masters. Mr. Chase, from the
antislavery wing, demanded that a claim of this kind be put on the same
footing as any other statutory right. "Claims of right in the services of
individuals found under the protection of the laws of a free
State must be investigated in the same manner as other claims of right.
If the most ordinary controversy involving a contested claim of twenty
dollars must be decided by jury, surely a controversy which involves the
right of a man to his liberty should have a similar trial.... It will not
do for a man to go into a State where every legal presumption is in favor
of freedom, and seize a person whom he claims as a fugitive slave, and
say, 'This man is my slave, and by my authority under the Constitution of
the United States I carry him off, and whoever interferes does so at his
peril.' He is asked, 'Where is your warrant?' and he produces none;
'Where is your evidence of claim?' and he offers none. The language of
his action is, 'My word stands for law.'"</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;33. Change in <a id="ge_in"></a>character of cases.</b>&mdash;The cases of escape which occur in
the period beginning with the formation of the Constitution, and ending
with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850, will be found, in
comparison with those of colonial times, much more frequent, more complex
in action, and more varied in detail. Instead of many colonies under
governments independent one of another, there was now one government and
one country; nevertheless, the extinction of the system of
bondage and the rise of the antislavery sentiment in the Northern States
brought into the cases new and difficult elements. No attempt will be
made to mention the cases in their chronological order, or to describe
them all. They will be classified into cases of simple escape, of
kidnapping, of rescue, and of State interference; and typical examples
will be described in each category.</p>


<h3><span>The First Case of Rescue.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;34. The f<a id="irst"></a>irst case of rescue.</b>&mdash;The first attempt to enforce the act of
1793, of which any record has been discovered, immediately revealed its
unfairness, and the indisposition of the North to carry it out.</p>

<p>Mr. Josiah Quincy, then a young lawyer, afterwards known as a public man
and the President of Harvard College, has left an interesting account of
his connection with the case. "He states that the process was issued by a
justice of the peace, that he was retained as counsel for the alleged
slave, that he prepared his brief, and went down loaded with all the
necessary authorities. He found a great crowd of people assembled; but
while he was in the midst of the argument, he heard a noise, and, turning
around, he saw the constables lying sprawling on the floor, and a passage
opening through the crowd, through which the fugitive was taking his
departure without stopping to hear the opinion of the court, and that was
the last of that case, and that was the last of the law of 1793 in
<a id="Massachusetts169"></a>Massachusetts."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn169">169</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;35. Pre<a id="side"></a>sident Washington's demand for a fugitive.</b>&mdash;As has been noticed
in a previous chapter, George Washington's boyhood was connected with
white slavery. Now, at the zenith of his public life, we find one of his
chattels the occasion of the first recorded refusal on moral grounds to
return a slave. In 1796, President Washington wrote to Mr.
Whipple, Collector of Portsmouth, N. H., to send back to him one of his
slaves who had escaped to that place, if it could be done without
exciting a mob. This letter has been preserved, and the following extract
gives us an insight into President Washington's opinions upon the
rendition of fugitives:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"However well disposed I might be to gradual abolition, or even to an
entire emancipation of that description of people, (if the latter was in
itself practicable,) at this moment it would neither be politic nor just
to reward unfaithfulness with a premature preference, and thereby
discontent beforehand the minds of all her fellow serv'ts, who, by their
steady attachment, are far more deserving than herself of <a id="favor170"></a>favor."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn170">170</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Whipple answered, that any return would be impossible; public
sentiment was too strong against it.</p>




<h3><span>Kidnapping.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;36. Kidnappi<a id="ng_ca"></a>ng cases.</b>&mdash;The great number of cases of kidnapping
throughout the period from 1793 to 1850 show what cruel and unjust deeds
were possible under the existing system, and served as nothing else could
to rouse people to the defence of negroes. Various were the methods by
which, in spite of law, kidnappers were enabled to secure their prey.
Perhaps the most common practice, in places where the courts were known
to be friendly to slavery, was to arrest a man on some false pretence,
and then, when he appeared in court without opportunity to secure papers
or witnesses, to claim him as a fugitive slave. Most of these cases
occurred in communities bordering upon or near the Southern States. The
risk and trouble of transporting slaves across free States were so great,
that up to 1850 we seldom hear of kidnapping cases, and rarely of the
capture of a genuine fugitive in the New England States.</p>

<p>The natural consequence of such acts of outrageous violence was to rouse
people to the forcible rescue of the captured negroes. In the earliest
cases, colored people seem to take the leadership; later on, the whites
joined, and became most active in the work.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;37. <a id="Jones_case"></a>Jones case.</b>&mdash;The following instance well exemplifies this form of
oppression. George Jones, a respectable colored man, was arrested on
Broadway, New York, in 1836, on the pretext that he had committed assault
and battery. As he knew that no such charge could be sustained against
him, he at first refused to go with his captors; but finally he yielded,
on the assurance of his employer that everything possible should
be done for him. He was then placed in Bridewell, and his friends were
told that when they were wanted they "would be sent for"; but, soon after
one o'clock that same day, he was taken before the Hon. Richard Riker,
Recorder of New York, and to the satisfaction of that magistrate was
proved to be a slave. Thus, in less than two hours after his arrest he
was hurried away as the property of the kidnappers: their word had been
accepted as sufficient evidence, and he had not been allowed to secure
the presence of a single friendly <a id="witness171"></a>witness.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn171">171</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;38. S<a id="olomo"></a>olomon Northup case.</b>&mdash;Sometimes, if they feared to enter their
case in court, slave hunters could find opportunity, by watching a negro
for a while, to carry out their plans through some small deception. One
of the most striking of these cases is that of Solomon Northup, who has
written an account of his experiences as freeman and as slave. He was
born in 1808 in New York State. His father had been made a free man by
the provisions of his master's will. Thus Solomon was brought up under
the influences of freedom, and knew little of slavery. After his
marriage, he lived for some years in Saratoga. Here he earned a
comfortable livelihood. During the day he worked about the hotels, and in
the evenings he was often engaged to play the violin at parties. One day,
two men, apparently managers of a travelling circus company, met him and
offered him good pay if he would go with them as a violinist to
Washington. He consented. Their behavior seemed to him peculiar, but he
remained in their service, only to find himself one morning in a slave
pen in Washington. How he got there remained always a mystery, but it is
evident that he must have been drugged. Resistance was useless. He was
carried South and sold to Mr. Epps, a hard master, with whom he remained
for twelve years.</p>

<p>After he had long given up all hopes of escape, a friend was found in a
Northern man who was working on the same plantation. Mr. Bass consented,
though at a great risk to himself, to write some letters, telling
Solomon's story to his Northern friends. The letters reached their
destination, and, under the law of 1840 against kidnapping, a memorial
was prepared to the Governor of New York. He became interested, and
immediately sent a man South to find Northrup. After a long search, the
agent was directed to Mr. Epps's plantation. Much to the
disappointment of the master, who used every means to prevent his return,
Solomon was identified at last, and went back to New York again a free
man. Efforts were made to prosecute the kidnappers; but as sufficient
evidence could not be obtained, no case was made <a id="out172"></a>out.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn172">172</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;39. <a id="Washington_case"></a>Washington case.</b>&mdash;So bold did these stealers of men become, that
they sometimes resorted to simple force, without the slightest attempt at
concealment. A case of this kind occurred in Washington, D. C., between
1840 and 1850. Three or four men seized a negro who was employed in a
hotel near the Capitol, and dragged him away. Mr. Hall, proprietor of the
house, after trying in vain to prevent the arrest, succeeded at last in
compelling them to take the man before a magistrate. The justice declined
to assume jurisdiction in such a case, and before any other protection
could be provided, the man was hurried by the kidnappers into a hack, and
taken across the Potomac into <a id="bondage173"></a>bondage.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn173">173</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;40. <a id="Ober"></a>Oberlin case.</b>&mdash;Occasionally the result was less fortunate for the
captors. In Oberlin, three slave hunters seized by force a negro man and
his wife, and carried them to an inn for the night. In the mean time the
people of the town decided that the negroes must have a trial. They
therefore employed a lawyer, who discovered that the writ for the capture
was illegal, and secured a hearing. The captives were placed in jail,
but, aided by some undivulged agency, they managed to break the grates of
their prison windows, and escaped to Canada before the day set for
<a id="trial174"></a>trial.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn174">174</a></sup></p>



<h3><span>Interference and Rescues.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;41. Int<a id="erfer"></a>erference and rescues.</b>&mdash;After a kidnapping case had occurred in
a Northern village or town, measures were frequently taken by the
indignant citizens to prevent the recurrence of such acts. They organized
vigilance committees, or the antislavery societies took it up as a part
of their work. In a free community, public sentiment would not allow
negro towns-people to stand entirely unprotected. Thus many of the cases
of interference and rescue were the result of some organized movements on
the part of the white people, though occasionally they came about through
the unpremeditated action of a mob.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;42. Ch<a id="ickas"></a>ickasaw rescue.</b>&mdash;The first case which has been found occurred in
1836. A writ of habeas corpus was served against Captain
Eldridge of the brig Chickasaw, for holding two colored women in his ship
with the intention of carrying them South. As both presented free papers
at the hearing, the judge ordered them discharged; but the agent of John
B. Morris of Baltimore, who demanded their return, declared that he would
soon have sufficient evidence to prove them fugitives. Thereupon the
colored people rushed in, took the women to a carriage, and carried them
away to <a id="safety175"></a>safety.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn175">175</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;43. <a id="Philadelphia_and_Kennedy"></a>Philadelphia and Kennedy cases.</b>&mdash;A similar but unsuccessful attempt
was made in Philadelphia in 1838. A slave had been delivered to the man
claiming to be his master. As the captors were about to take him away, a
crowd of colored people gathered and attempted to rescue him. It was not
so simple a matter in a large city as in a country town. A body of police
soon appeared, protected the slaveholders, and finally arrested some of
the leaders among the free <a id="blacks176"></a>blacks.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn176">176</a></sup></p>

<p>A few years later, in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, three negroes were arrested
and their identity established as the slaves of Messrs. Kennedy and
Hollingsworth of Maryland. The colored people of the neighborhood had
caused a writ of habeas corpus to be issued and a second hearing was
held. Judge Hepburne decided that the magistrate first employed had no
right to commit the alleged fugitives, but he himself remanded them. A
riot ensued, and some thirty-six persons were tried for participating in
<a id="it177"></a>it.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn177">177</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;44. L<a id="atim"></a>atimer case.</b>&mdash;In the Latimer case, the first of that series of
famous fugitive slave trials which took place in Boston, was strongly
developed the feeling against kidnapping, or in fact against the
rendition of a slave under any circumstances.</p>

<p>In 1842, George Latimer was seized in Boston without a warrant, at the
request of James B. Grey of Norfolk, Virginia. Latimer's counsel, Samuel
E. Sewall and Amos B. Merrill, sued out a writ of habeas corpus, but
after argument Chief Justice Shaw denied it. Mr. Grey asked for time to
procure evidence against Latimer from Virginia. The judge ruled that the
request should be granted, and that Latimer should for the time being be
kept in the custody of the city jailer, Nathaniel Cooledge. A writ of
personal replevin, under the act of 1837 securing trial by <a id="jury178"></a>jury,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn178">178</a></sup> was
then sworn out, but Justice Shaw decided that, according to the
decision by the Supreme Court in the Prigg case, the law was
<a id="illegal179"></a>illegal.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn179">179</a></sup></p>

<p>The proceedings aroused great indignation throughout the city and State.
Meetings to devise means of aiding Latimer were held in Faneuil Hall and
Belknap Street church. Stirring speeches were made by Wendell Phillips
and others, and resolutions condemning the proceedings of the
authorities, and remonstrating against the return of Latimer, were
adopted. Bands of ruffians strove to break up the meetings, and succeeded
in greatly disturbing them. To rouse the people, to give expression to
public sentiment, and to spread the news from day to day, Dr. H. I.
Bowditch and Dr. W. F. Channing edited a paper called "The Latimer
Journal and North Star." This was published for a number of weeks by the
friends of the fugitive. Petitions were sent to the sheriff to remove the
jailer, and to the Governor asking the removal of the sheriff if he did
not accede to their demand. Thereupon Latimer's custodian agreed to give
him up for a sufficient payment. The sum of four hundred dollars was
accordingly raised, the proceedings came to an abrupt termination, and
Latimer was released.</p>

<p>The excitement produced, however, did not die out immediately, and some
of the results were far-reaching. So intense was the public excitement,
that, soon after, a petition was prepared and sent to Congress, asking an
amendment to the Constitution. This was signed by fifty thousand people
in Massachusetts, and presented in the House by Mr. Adams. Another,
signed by sixty-five thousand people, was sent to the legislature. The
effect was the act of 1843, forbidding all officers to aid in the
recapture of a fugitive slave, or to permit the use of State jails for
their imprisonment. The petition to Congress was not received. A
resolution from the Latimer committee, which proposed an amendment to the
Constitution so as to base representation on "free persons," brought
about much discussion, and was not received in the House. In the Senate
it excited even more violent opposition, and the resolutions were laid on
the table and not <a id="printed180"></a>printed.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn180">180</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;45. <a id="Ottoman_case"></a>Ottoman case.</b>&mdash;Similar indignation was felt in Boston over the case
of Captain Hannum of the brig Ottoman. He had found a runaway concealed
on board, but had set sail to return, evidently with the intention of
taking the man back into captivity. A steamer was sent out to
rescue the slave, but the Ottoman managed to elude it, and the man was
lost. At a meeting held September 24, 1846, a committee was appointed for
the purpose of preventing similar <a id="outrages181"></a>outrages.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn181">181</a></sup></p>


<h3> <span>Interstate Relations.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;46. In<a id="ters"></a>terstate relations.</b>&mdash;The spirit of opposition to the execution of
the Fugitive Slave Law made itself felt, not only in popular
demonstrations and in legislation, but in interstate relations. We have
already noticed the Prigg <a id="case182"></a>case,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn182">182</a></sup> and its effect in relieving the
States from any responsibility in the enforcement of the law. Other
States took advantage of this decision, and of the general principle of
international law, that one nation or state is not bound to enforce the
municipal law of another.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;47. <a id="Boston_and_Isaac"></a>Boston and Isaac cases (1837-1839).</b>&mdash;In 1837 a runaway was found on
the ship Boston, then on her homeward voyage from Georgia to Maine. After
landing, the slave succeeded in getting to Canada. The Governor of
Georgia charged the captain with slave-stealing, and demanded his return
as a fugitive from justice. The Governor of Maine would not comply with
the request, because, as he said, the laws of that State recognized
slaves not as property, but as persons. The indignant legislature of
Georgia adopted resolutions calling upon Congress so to amend the laws
that the Governor of Maine should be compelled to give up slave stealers
as fugitives from justice. Resolutions were presented in the United
States Senate, but no action was <a id="taken183"></a>taken.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn183">183</a></sup></p>

<p>The refusal to use State machinery against fugitives extended to the
process of extradition against persons connected with the rescue of
slaves. Thus in the Isaac case, in 1839, Virginia asked New York for the
arrest of three colored men who were accused of abetting a slave's
escape. The Governor of New York returned answer, that no State could
demand the surrender of a fugitive from justice for an act which was made
criminal only by its own <a id="legislation184"></a>legislation.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn184">184</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp; 48. <a id="Ohio_and_Kentucky"></a>Ohio and Kentucky case.</b>&mdash;Kentucky, in 1848, demanded from the
Governor of Ohio the extradition of fifteen persons on the charge of
aiding the escape of a fugitive. Governor Bell refused, on the ground
that Ohio laws did not recognize property in <a id="man185"></a>man.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn185">185</a></sup></p>



<h3><span>Prosecutions. Act of 1850.</span></h3>

 <p><b>§&nbsp;49. Pr<a id="osec"></a>osecutions.</b>&mdash;The effects of the aid and protection thus given
fugitives by Northern people or governments awakened among the
slaveholders a feeling of wrong and indignation. The Fugitive Slave Law
was clear, and they determined to carry it out to the letter. They began,
therefore, energetically to prosecute people for aiding and harboring
escaping slaves. The case just mentioned shows how difficult it was to
secure prosecutions beyond the State boundaries. When the offence
occurred within the bounds of a slave State, the judgments were most
severe, and the heaviest possible fines and longest terms of imprisonment
were inflicted for simple acts of charity.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;50. Van Zandt, Pearl, <a id="and_Walker_cases"></a>and Walker cases.</b>&mdash;Mr. Van Zandt, returning into
the country from Cincinnati one day in 1840, took nine fugitive slaves
from Kentucky into his farm wagon. He was stopped by three persons, and
all but two of the slaves were recaptured. Mr. Van Zandt was arrested,
taken into court, and fined twelve thousand dollars, which exhausted his
entire <a id="property186"></a>property.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn186">186</a></sup></p>


<p>A still more severe penalty was that imposed upon Captain Drayton, of the
schooner Pearl, in 1848. He took on board seventy-five fugitive slaves,
and sailed up the Potomac. An armed steamer, sent in pursuit, overtook
them and brought them back. Captain Drayton and another officer of the
schooner were placed in prison, where they remained for twenty years, and
at last were relieved only through the efforts of Charles <a id="Sumner187"></a>Sumner.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn187">187</a></sup></p>

<p>Another instance of the same sort is the case of Mr. Jonathan Walker, in
1844. With seven fugitives he embarked from Pensacola in an open boat for
the Bahama Islands, but he received a sun-stroke and was obliged to leave
the management of the craft in the hands of the negroes. On account of
the accident, they were overtaken by two sloops, and both fugitives and
their protector captured. Mr. Walker was twice tried, imprisoned,
sentenced to stand in the pillory, and branded on the hand with the
letters S. S., slave <a id="stealer188"></a>stealer.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn188">188</a></sup> The crime and the punishment have
alike been glorified in Whittier's verses:&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Then lift that manly right hand, bold ploughman of the wave!</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Its branded hand shall prophesy 'Salvation to the Slave!'</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Hold up its fire-wrought language that whoso reads may feel</span><br />
<span class="i0">"His heart swell strong within him, his sinews change to <a id="steel189"></a>steel."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn189">189</a></sup></span></div>


<p><b>§&nbsp;51. <a id="Unpopularity"></a>Unpopularity of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.</b>&mdash;The
passage of the new law probably increased the number of antislavery
people more than anything else which had occurred during the whole
agitation. Many of those formerly indifferent were roused to active
opposition by a sense of the injustice of the Fugitive Slave Act as they
saw it executed in Boston and elsewhere. Hence, in the cases of the
period from 1850 to the outbreak of the Civil War, we shall find a new
element. The antislavery party, grown strong, resisted the regulations,
and instead of the unquestioned return of a fugitive, as in colonial
times, or of prosecutions carried on under the simple conditions of the
act of 1793, the struggle became long and complex. In fact during this
time hardly an important case can be cited in which there was not some
opposition to the natural course of the law. These exasperating effects
were not at first apparent to the South, since before the famous rescues
began several cases of rendition showed the power of the Executive. As
the escapes grew more and more frequent yearly, increasing all the time
in boldness, the slaveholders put forth greater efforts to punish the
offenders, and prosecutions were numerous. But the "new law had no moral
foundation," and against such an act public sentiment must sooner or
later revolt, no matter how severe may be its <a id="provisions190"></a>provisions.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn190">190</a></sup> As Mr.
James Freeman Clarke has said, "It was impossible to convince the people
that it was right to send back to slavery men who were so desirous of
freedom as to run such risks. All education from boyhood up to manhood
had taught us to believe that it was the duty of all men to struggle for
<a id="freedom191"></a>freedom."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn191">191</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;52. Pri<a id="ncip"></a>nciple of the selection of cases.</b>&mdash;The large number of cases
occurring between 1850 and 1860 renders it impossible to present a
detailed account of them all in a brief monograph. The selection,
therefore, includes only such as are typical of the various phases of the
agitation.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;53. <a id="Hamlet_case"></a>Hamlet case (1850).</b>&mdash;The first recorded action under the provisions
of the law of 1850 took place on the 26th of September of that year, just
eight days after the passage of the act. James Hamlet, a free negro, who
with his family had been living for several years in New York, was on
that day arrested by a deputy United States Marshal as the fugitive slave
of Mary Brown of Baltimore. After a hasty examination by Commissioner
Gardiner, he was surrendered in accordance with the new law.
These proceedings were not sufficiently well known at the time to excite
a mob, but when discovered they roused so strong a feeling that the money
necessary to redeem Hamlet was almost immediately raised, and on the 5th
of October he was brought back from <a id="slavery192"></a>slavery.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn192">192</a></sup></p>



<h3><span>Sims and Burns.</span></h3>

 <p><b>§&nbsp;54. S<a id="ims"></a>ims case (1851).</b>&mdash;Another instance in Boston, often mentioned as
the first under the law of 1850, but really six months later than the
Hamlet case, is that of Thomas M. Sims. A common method of seizure was
followed. Marshal Tukey arrested Sims on a false charge of theft. Mr.
Potter of Virginia then claimed him as his slave. Court Square was filled
with people. The Marshal feared a popular outbreak while the matter was
pending, and, to the indignation of the city, caused the court-house in
which Sims was confined to be surrounded with chains. As these were but
four feet from the ground, the judges as they went in and out from the
sessions were forced, morning and night, to bow beneath them. The
building was also strongly guarded by a company of armed men, ever
afterward known as the "Sims Brigade." Robert Rantoul, Jr. and Samuel E.
Sewall conducted Sims's case. Commissioner Curtis overruled the
constitutional objections to the Fugitive Slave Law, and to the judicial
functions of the Commissioners of the United States courts. Then, despite
all efforts of the antislavery people in his behalf, the certificate
which sent Sims back to Virginia was made out and signed by Commissioner
<a id="Curtis193"></a>Curtis.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn193">193</a></sup> The Liberator says of the popular sentiment: "One feeling
was visible on almost every countenance, commiseration,
humiliation,&mdash;commiseration for the victim, humiliation at the
degradation of Massachusetts. No man talked, no man thought, of violence.
Why? Because it is acquiesced in? No! no! Because it is approved? A
thousand times, no! but because government is pleased to enforce the law,
and resistance is <a id="hopeless194"></a>hopeless."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn194">194</a></sup> Sims was taken from his cell in the
early morning, observed only by a few faithful vigilants, and, amid
platoons of armed men, conducted to the United States ship Acorn, which
was detailed to carry him back to the <a id="South195"></a>South.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn195">195</a></sup></p>

<p>The indignation of the antislavery people remained to be expressed, and a
mass meeting was held on the Common and in Tremont Temple.
Wendell Phillips and Theodore Parker addressed the assemblage, and
Phillips noticed the fact that hostile troops had not been seen in the
streets of Boston since the redcoats marched up from Long <a id="Wharf196"></a>Wharf.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn196">196</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;55. B<a id="urns"></a>urns case (1854).</b>&mdash;The rendition of Anthony Burns in 1854 was the
last great fugitive slave case which occurred in Boston. Burns was the
property of Charles F. Suttle of Virginia. He escaped in 1854, and came
to Boston. One of the first things he did was to write a letter to his
brother, still a slave in the South. Unfortunately, though this was
mailed in Canada, by some oversight it was dated in Boston. Since a
letter to a slave was always opened by the master, Burns's hiding place
was <a id="discovered197"></a>discovered.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn197">197</a></sup> He was arrested upon the usual charge of theft.
Then, upon a warrant issued by Judge Loring, he was claimed as a fugitive
slave by Suttle.</p>

<p>When the knowledge of the arrest began to circulate, the most intense
excitement prevailed. Handbills asking all antislavery people to go to
Boston were sent throughout the country. Public meetings held in Faneuil
and Meionaon Halls were crowded with representatives from all the towns
<a id="about198"></a>about.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn198">198</a></sup> One of the people who took part in the attempted rescue which
followed one of these meetings thus describes it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"On the evening of the 26th of May, we went down to Faneuil Hall to hear
Wendell Phillips. He counselled waiting until morning before any attempt
to rescue Burns should be made, but the excited audience silenced him
with shouts of 'No, no! to-night! to-night!'</p>

<p>"Mr. Phillips saw that it was useless to try to go on, so he sat down and
Mr. Theodore Parker began speaking. At first he advocated the same plan,
but at last, as he found the crowd growing more and more eager and
uproarious, he said, 'Well, if you will, let us go!' and led the way out
of the hall. The people followed, and my friend and I were among the
first to reach the court-house. There we found prepared for us long beams
and boxes of axes. Five or six men seized one of these beams, and before
its pressure the large door of the court-house crushed like glass. Mr.
Higginson first stepped in, but just then a pistol shot was heard, and
the mob fell back. Mr. Higginson looked around, and entreated
them not to desert him, but the favorable moment was gone. The people
should have lost no time in filling the house, for the marines had been
ordered from the Navy Yard, and when they appeared nothing further could
be <a id="done199"></a>done."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn199">199</a></sup> In this riot James Batchelder, one of the Marshal's
guards, was killed. </p>
</div>


<p>At the trial, though Burns was ably defended by Mr. R. H. Dana and
others, it was of no avail. His identity was unfortunately established
from the first. He had recognized and addressed his master, and also a
Mr. Brant, who had once hired him. The order for his rendition was
therefore at once <a id="given200"></a>given.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn200">200</a></sup></p>

<p>Guarded by a large military force he was conducted through the streets,
filled with an indignant multitude, to the United States cutter Morris,
which had been ordered by the President to take him <a id="back201"></a>back.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn201">201</a></sup> Many
buildings on the route were hung with black, and so great was the popular
excitement, that Rev. J. F. Clarke, an eyewitness of the affair, has
said: "It was evident that a very trifling incident might have brought on
a collision, and flooded the streets with blood."</p>

<p>The difficulty of enforcing the act was shown in the precautionary
measures immediately adopted by the government. The city police, the
militia, the marines, and some regular troops, were ordered out to the
task of guarding one poor fugitive. It cost the country one hundred
thousand dollars to send this single slave back to his <a id="master202"></a>master.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn202">202</a></sup></p>

<p>Not long after Burns's return, a sum of money, to which Charles Devens,
United States Marshal at his trial, contributed largely, was raised in
Boston and the vicinity for his purchase; but it was found impossible to
effect <a id="it203"></a>it.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn203">203</a></sup></p>

<p>Mr. Higginson, Wendell Phillips, and Theodore Parker, with others, were
indicted for riot, but the indictment was quashed by Judge Curtis on
technical grounds, and they were <a id="discharged204"></a>discharged.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn204">204</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Garner and Shadrach.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;56. <a id="Garner"></a>Garner case (1856).</b>&mdash;Of all the cases of rendition, the saddest,
and next to the Burns case probably the best known at the time,
was that of Margaret Garner. In accounts of the Underground Railroad we
are told that winter was the favorite season for flight in the section of
the country south of the Ohio, since ice then covered the river, and the
difficulty of crossing by boat did not arise. It was at this season that
Simeon Garner, his son Robert, and their families, fled from Kentucky and
crossed the frozen stream to the house of a colored man in Cincinnati.
They were soon traced thither, and after a desperate hand to hand
struggle the house was entered. There the pursuers found that Margaret
Garner, preferring for her children death to slavery, had striven to take
their lives, and one lay dead. The case was immediately brought into
court, where, despite the efforts made to save them, rendition was
decided upon. On the way back, Margaret, in despair, attempted to drown
herself and her child in the river; but even the deliverance of death was
denied her, for she was recovered and sold, to be carried yet farther
<a id="south205"></a>south.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn205">205</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;57. Sh<a id="adrac"></a>adrach case (1851).</b>&mdash;In the three typical cases just described,
neither the law's delay, violent interference, nor the desperation of the
slave, availed to prevent the return of the fugitive to the oppressor.
Let us turn from this group, and take up those more important cases
wherein the law was not allowed to complete its course, but rescues were
accomplished, either by free negroes or antislavery people. First in time
and importance comes the case of Shadrach, which occurred in Boston in
February, 1851.</p>

<p>In May, 1850, a slave named Frederic Wilkins had run away from Virginia
and come to Boston, where he found employment as a waiter in the Cornhill
Coffee House under the alias of Shadrach. He had been there not quite a
year, however, when John De Bere, his master in Norfolk, sent some one in
pursuit of him. A warrant was served and he was arrested while at work.
United States Commissioner Riley then took him to the court-house, where
Mr. List, a young lawyer of antislavery sympathies, offered his aid as
counsel, and Messrs. Charles G. Davis, Samuel E. Sewall, and Ellis Gray
Loring also came to his assistance. Mr. List obtained some delay in the
proceedings; but since, by the act <a id="of206"></a>of 1843,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn206">206</a></sup> the use of State jails
had been denied for fugitives, the officers were obliged to keep the
prisoner in the court-room until another place of confinement could be
found. By this time a large number of people had gathered about the
building, and were trying to force an entrance. For a long time
they were unable to enter, but at last opportunity was given as Mr. Davis
opened the door to leave the court-room. In spite of all efforts on the
part of the officers to close the door, a body of colored people under
the lead of Lewis Hayden rushed in and seized the prisoner. They carried
him triumphantly out of the court-room on their shoulders, and soon saw
him safely started for Canada. Mr. Davis and others were prosecuted for
aiding in the rescue, but nothing was proved against them. Intense
excitement prevailed in the city, and finally throughout the country,
since Congress took up this infringement of the <a id="law207"></a>law.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn207">207</a></sup></p>

<p>Mr. Clay, February 17, 1851, introduced a resolution which requested the
President to send to Congress "any information he may possess in regard
to the alleged recent case of a forcible resistance to the execution of
the laws of the United States in the city of Boston," and communicate to
Congress "what means he has adopted to meet the occurrence," and
"whether, in his opinion, any additional legislation is necessary to meet
the exigencies of the <a id="case208"></a>case."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn208">208</a></sup> President Pierce then issued a
proclamation announcing the facts to the country, and calling on all
people to assist in quelling this and other disturbances. The Senate's
request was also answered in an Executive message to Congress, which
announced to them that the President would use all his constitutional
powers to insure the execution of the laws. Such unusual national
interference gave the case wide celebrity, and, as Von Holst says, "The
pretensions and assumptions of the South were encouraged in a very unwise
way, by the fact that, by such a manner of treating the matter, people
seemed to recognize that it was entitled to hold the whole North
responsible for every violation of the compromise, which could properly
be laid at the door of only a few individuals. The proclamation and the
message placed the compromise in a far more glaring light than the
liberation of <a id="Shadrach209"></a>Shadrach."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn209">209</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Rescues.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;58. <a id="Jerry_McHenry"></a>Jerry McHenry rescue (1851).</b>&mdash;Later, a case occurred at Syracuse,
New York, which was a significant illustration of the successful action
of a vigilance committee. Jerry McHenry, a respectable colored man who
had lived for several years in that city, was arrested in
October, 1851, as a fugitive slave. At the examination, which took place
at two o'clock in the afternoon, he found opportunity to break away from
the officers and escape through the crowd, which opened to allow him to
pass. He was, however, immediately pursued and recaptured. It so happened
that an Agricultural Fair and a convention of the Liberty Party were
going on at that time in Syracuse, and the city was unusually full of
people. When the alarm bell gave notice to the vigilance committee that a
negro had been seized, Mr. Gerrit Smith, who was attending the meetings,
and Rev. Samuel J. May, with others, hastened to the scene. The
Commissioner, after the capture, had again taken up the trial, but such a
disturbance was made by the crowd which gathered outside that he was
forced to adjourn. Meanwhile, Mr. Smith with the committee had planned a
rescue, and at about half-past eight fully two thousand people had
assembled, and an assault was begun upon the court-house. They broke
doors and windows, overpowered the officers, and at last bore Jerry away
in triumph.</p>

<p>He remained in the home of a friend until he could be sent to Canada.
Prosecutions were immediately instituted, and eighteen persons indicted
for taking part in the rescue, but nothing came of the case. On the other
side, Henry W. Allen, Marshal in the case, was tried for kidnapping. The
judge declared the Fugitive Slave Act unconstitutional, but a verdict of
not guilty was <a id="rendered210"></a>rendered.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn210">210</a></sup></p>


<p><b>§&nbsp;59. Oberlin-Wellington <a id="rescue_1858"></a>rescue (1858).</b>&mdash;Sometimes, however, general
sentiment was so strong that the rescue became, not an action instigated
and carried through by three or four determined men, but the indignant
uprising of a whole town. Such was the Oberlin-Wellington case,
celebrated for the great number of prosecutions and the high character of
those engaged in it. Two kidnappers from Kentucky induced an Oberlin boy,
by a bribe of twenty dollars, to entice away a negro named John Rice on
pretence of giving him work. Having taken him to a lonely spot, he was
seized and carried about eight miles across country to Wellington, there
to await the south bound train.</p>

<p>On the way the party was overtaken by an Oberlin College student, who at
once gave the alarm. A crowd gathered and followed the kidnappers to the
railway station. There, by placing a ladder upon the balcony
they succeeded in rescuing John from the upper story of the house in
which he was confined. For this violation of the law thirty-seven
citizens of Oberlin and Wellington were indicted. This produced the
greatest excitement all over the country, and the case grew more and more
complicated, until the proceedings had lasted several months. Public
meetings to express sympathy with the prosecuted were held in many
places. Some of them were imprisoned to await the trial, but no severe
sentences were <a id="imposed211"></a>imposed.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn211">211</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Castner Hanway. John Brown.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;60. <a id="Christiana"></a>Christiana&nbsp;case&nbsp;(1851).</b>&mdash;Occasionally the rescue of fugitives was
not accomplished by a sudden unorganized movement, but by a deliberate
armed defence on the part of the slaves and their friends. In the
Christiana case the affair was marked by violence and bloodshed, while
the fact that the Quakers Castner Hanway and Elijah Lewis were afterward
prosecuted made it notorious; and the further fact that the charge was
not, as usual, that of aiding a fugitive, but of treason, gave it still
greater interest.</p>

<p>In and about Christiana, Pennsylvania, there were many negroes who had
formerly been slaves, descriptions of whom were frequently furnished to
kidnappers by a band of men known throughout the country as the "Gap
Gang." A league for mutual protection had therefore been formed by the
colored people, and prominent among them for intelligence and boldness
was William Parker. Soon after the passage of the law of 1850, Edward
Gorsuch and a party came from Maryland to Christiana for a fugitive
slave. With United States officers from Philadelphia they went
immediately to the house of William Parker, where the man they were
seeking was sheltered. When their demand was refused, they fired two
shots at the house. This roused the people, and a riot ensued in which
the fugitive escaped. Mr. Gorsuch was killed, his son desperately
wounded, and the rest put to flight. Castner Hanway at the beginning of
the struggle was notified of the kidnappers' presence, and, though feeble
in health, hastened to the scene. When ordered by Marshal Kline to aid
him in accordance with the law, he refused; yet, far from leading in the
affair, he tried in every way to prevent bloodshed and bring about peace.</p>

<p>After it was over, Parker, with two other colored men, knowing that
arrest must follow, secreted themselves under piles of shavings in an old carpenter's shop. At night they sent four wagons in different
directions as decoys for the detectives, and were carried safely away by
a fifth. Many negroes hid that night in the corn shocks, and under the
floors of houses, until escape could be made in <a id="safety212"></a>safety.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn212">212</a></sup></p>

<p>Castner Hanway was arrested, and arraigned before the United States court
on the charge of treason; but no proof of a conspiracy to make a general
and public resistance to the law could be found, and he was acquitted.
Afterward it was desired to try Hanway and Lewis for "riot and murder,"
but the grand jury ignored the bill, and all prisoners were released.
With these prosecutions the end of the affair was apparently reached,
though perhaps its influence may be traced in a succeeding case.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;61. Miller <a id="case_1851"></a>case (1851).</b>&mdash;A noted kidnapper from Maryland, in 1851,
seized a free negro girl living at the house of Mr. Miller, in
Nottingham, Pennsylvania, and took her to Baltimore. Mr. Miller followed
them, and succeeded in getting her freed. He then started back, but never
reached home. Search was made, and his body found upon the way. It was
thought that the murder was committed in revenge for the part he had
taken in the Christiana <a id="riot213"></a>riot.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn213">213</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;62. John Brown in <a id="Kansas_1858"></a>Kansas (1858).</b>&mdash;It was during this period also that
John Brown was endeavoring to put into execution his famous plan for
freeing the slaves. This is interesting, not only as typical of organized
efforts to free the slaves on the plantations, but also because of its
connection with other phases of the slavery question, into which we shall
not attempt to enter here. His idea was first to gather as large a force
as possible, then, when his men were properly drilled, to run off the
slaves in large numbers; to retain the brave and strong in the mountains,
and to send the weak and timid to the North by the "Underground
<a id="Railroad214"></a>Railroad."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn214">214</a></sup></p>

<p>In December, 1858, Brown divided his forces into two divisions, and went
into Missouri. Here he succeeded in freeing eleven slaves, and, though
pursued by a far superior number of Missourians, took them safely into
Kansas. The affair, by its boldness, created great excitement throughout
the South. The Governor of Missouri offered three thousand dollars
reward, and the President of the United States two hundred and
fifty dollars, for Brown's capture; within a very short time he had
succeeded in conveying himself and his eleven fugitives safely into

<p><b>§&nbsp;63. <a id="Methods_of_escape"></a>Methods of escape.</b>&mdash;The great increase in the number of fugitives
after 1850 was in part due to the uneasiness felt by Northern people
under a law which made them co-workers with the South in a system of
slave hunting, and in part to the greater ease of communication now
afforded between the two sections. The knowledge that there was in the
North a body of "abolitionists" eager to aid them from bondage to freedom
was also spreading more widely each day among the slaves.</p>

<p>Public interest in the subject was more and more aroused, not only by the
cases of cruelty and injustice which were forcibly brought to the
attention of Northern communities, but also by the romantic and thrilling
episodes of the escapes. To understand the attitude of the North toward
fugitives, it is necessary to examine some of the different methods used
by the fugitives in their flight. Perhaps a better point of view than
that of the outside observer will be gained by placing ourselves in the
position of the slave, and examining his motives for flight, the
difficulties which he encountered at home, the manner in which he
overcame them, and, finally, the various paths of escape then open to
him, and the agencies which befriended him and forwarded him on his way.</p>



<h3><span>Reasons for Escape.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;64. Re<a id="ason"></a>asons for escape.</b>&mdash;First, why did the slave seek to escape?
However unlike the attending circumstances, we find upon investigation
that the negro's desire to run away may be traced to one of but three or
four motives. Among the more intelligent slaves, who could comprehend the
nature and injustice of their position, it often rose solely from the
upspringing in their hearts of that love of freedom natural to all men.
It is probable that in the greater number of cases this was the motive at
the root of the matter. A fugitive, on being questioned at an Underground
Railroad station as to his reasons for escape, replied that he had had a
kind master, plenty to eat and to wear, but that notwithstanding this for
many years he had been dissatisfied. He was thirsting for <a id="freedom216"></a>freedom.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn216">216</a></sup>
Another said that his owner had always been considerate, and even
indulgent to him. He left for no other reason than simply to gain his
<a id="liberty217"></a>liberty.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn217">217</a></sup></p>

<p>A second reason, and that which perhaps most frequently led them to take
the decisive step in this often long premeditated act, was the cruel
treatment received from their masters. An owner upon one of the Southern
plantations said his slaves usually ran away after they had been whipped,
or something had occurred to make them <a id="angry218"></a>angry.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn218">218</a></sup></p>

<p>A third and very effective cause was the fear of being sold South, where
slave life, spent in toil under the merciless masters of the rice swamps
and cotton fields, was seen on its darkest side. Such was the horror with
which the slave regarded this change, that the threat of it was
constantly used by owners as one of the surest means of reducing their
rebellious slaves to submission. In the Virginia Slave Mother's Farewell
to her Daughters who have been sold into Southern bondage, Whittier has
well expressed their <a id="feelings219"></a>feelings.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn219">219</a></sup></p>

<p>Many cases of this kind came to light through the examinations
at the Underground Railroad stations. Three brothers once learned that
the next day they were to be sent South with a slave trader then in the
vicinity. Filled with terror at the prospect, they preferred the danger
of death in the swamps to the certainty of life in the unknown country.
That night they made their escape, but it was only after weeks of
wandering in swamps and morasses that they reached a <a id="haven220"></a>haven.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn220">220</a></sup></p>

<p>So long as a black family remained together upon one plantation, their
love for one another operated as the strongest bond to prevent their
departure; but when, as constantly happened, the sale and separation of
the members scattered families far and wide, with no hope of reunion, the
firmest and often the sole tie which bound them to the South was broken.
There was no longer anything to hold them <a id="back221"></a>back.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn221">221</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;65. Co<a id="ndit"></a>nditions of slave life.</b>&mdash;These are some of the motives which led
the slave to plan an escape. It will now be well to glance at those
surrounding conditions, incident to the time and country, which made
successful flight particularly difficult. First, the slave was a negro;
and in the South, where the presumption was that every black man must be
a slave, the color of his skin gave not only a means of tracing him, but
also made him liable at any moment to questioning and arrest.</p>

<p>In both city and country patrols were appointed, whose duty it was to
keep strict watch over the negroes; and any slave found away from his
plantation, unless in livery or provided with a pass, could be
whipped and sent back to his <a id="master222"></a>master.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn222">222</a></sup> It was also lawful for any
white man to seize and carry a stray slave to the nearest <a id="jail223"></a>jail.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn223">223</a></sup> The
next morning, if not claimed, he was advertised in a manner of which the
following is an example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
    <p>"Was taken up and committed to the jail of Halifax Co., on the 26th
    day of May, a dark colored boy who says his name is Jordan Artis;
    said boy says he was born free, and bound out to Mr. Beale, near
    Murfreesboro, Hartford Co., N. C., and is now twenty-one years of
    age. Owner is requested to come forward, prove property, pay charges,
    and take said boy away within time prescribed by law, otherwise he
    will be dealt with as the law directs.</p>


   <p class="ralign5"> "<span class="smcap">O. P. Shell</span>, <i>Jailer.</i></p>

    <p>"Halifax Co., N. C., <a id="June224"></a>June 8, 1855."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn224">224</a></sup></p>
</div>


<p>If not claimed within one year, such a prisoner could be sold by the
jailer. Thus Olmsted remarks that "the security of the whites is not so
much dependent upon patrols, as on the constant, habitual, and
instinctive surveillance and authority of all white people over the
<a id="blacks225"></a>blacks."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn225">225</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;66. Escapes to the <a id="wood"></a>woods.</b>&mdash;If an opportunity for escape should present
itself, the first question for the slave was, "In what direction shall I
turn?" Many slaves knew nothing of the Northern people, or had heard of
Canada only as a cold, barren, uninviting country, where the negro must
perish. To those who had neither the courage nor the knowledge requisite
for a long journey, the woods and swamps near by offered the only refuge.
There they built cabins, or lived in caves, and got food by hunting and
fishing, and by raids upon the neighboring plantations.</p>

<p>In one of the papers of the day an underground den is noticed, the
opening of which, though in sight of two or three houses, and near roads
and fields, where passing was constant, had been so concealed by a pile
of straw, that for many months it had remained unnoticed. When
discovered, on opening a trap-door, steps were seen leading down into a
room about six feet square, comfortably ceiled with boards, and
containing a fire-place. The den was well stocked with food by the
occupants, who had been missing about a <a id="year226"></a>year.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn226">226</a></sup></p>

<p> In most cases slaves were not so bold, and preferred concealment
on an uninhabited island, or a bit of land surrounded by morasses. We
often find advertisements of the time, mentioning such places as the
probable refuge of runaways. The Savannah Georgian of 1839 offers a
reward for two men who have been out for eighteen months, and are
supposed to be encamped in a swamp near Pine Grove Plantation.</p>

<p>In the Great Dismal Swamp, which extends from near Norfolk, Virginia,
into North Carolina, a large colony of these fugitive negroes was
established, and so long was the custom continued that children were
born, grew up, and lived their whole lives in its dark recesses. Besides
their hunting and fishing, they sometimes obtained food and money, in
return for work, from the poor whites and the negroes who had homes on
the borders of the swamp. It was this practice of remaining out near home
which, under easy masters, brought about the habitual runaways,&mdash;men who
were constantly escaping, and after a little time returning, often of
their own <a id="accord227"></a>accord.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn227">227</a></sup> One of his masters said of William Browne,
afterward a well known speaker upon slavery, that he hesitated some time
before he invested seven hundred dollars in William, for he was "a noted
<a id="runaway228"></a>runaway."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn228">228</a></sup> Again, in a Southern paper advertising a sale of slaves,
one description is thus given: "Number 47, Daniel, a runaway, but has not
run away during the last two years, aged 28 <a id="years229"></a>years."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn229">229</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Escapes to <a id="the_N"></a>the North.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;67. Escapes to the North.</b>&mdash;Of those who, with heroic hearts and firm
courage, determined to reach even Canada, many had seldom left the
plantation on which they were born, and were so completely ignorant of
geography and relative distances, that the best and quickest way
northward could seldom be chosen. They knew nothing of the facilities for
communication possessed by their masters through newspapers and
telegraph, and would often fancy themselves safe when they had travelled
but a short distance from home. In reality, the white people about were
often fully informed against them, and arrests were almost sure to
<a id="follow230"></a>follow.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn230">230</a></sup></p>

<p>The journeys of the fugitives were necessarily long, since unfrequented
 ways were generally chosen, and but part of the day could be
used. There is a record of a man who had "taken a whole year in coming
from Alabama to Cincinnati. He had travelled only in the night, hiding in
the woods during the day. He had nothing to eat but what he could get
from the fields, sometimes finding a chicken, green corn, or perhaps a
small <a id="pig231"></a>pig."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn231">231</a></sup></p>

<p>Although the methods pursued were innumerable, and varied from those of
the man whose only guide was the north star, to those of the party aided
onward by the most elaborate arrangements of the Underground Railroad,
the fugitive was obliged to follow one of two great routes, by water or
by land. From the earliest times the ship had been a favorite refuge.
Once on board a craft bound to a Northern port, the fugitive was almost
certain of reaching that destination, and, once arrived, could hope for
protection from the Northern friends of whom vague rumors had penetrated
the South. New laws, therefore, bore more and more heavily upon captains
who should be found guilty of harboring a slave, and many cases were made
public of cruel treatment experienced by slaves at the hands of captains
who sent them directly back. Nevertheless, escapes on shipboard still
occurred frequently through the years of slavery. A method commonly used
by women in getting on board was to disarm suspicion by appearing to be
carrying some freshly laundered clothes to the sailors.</p>


<p><b>§&nbsp;68. Use of <a id="protection_papers"></a>protection papers.</b>&mdash;Another method called for less physical
effort on the part of the fugitive, but for greater coolness. It was
simply to procure from some freeman his protection papers, and to show
them whenever necessary to disarm suspicion. As the descriptions could
seldom be made to agree, both giver and receiver were placed in
situations of the greatest risk. It was thus, however, that Frederick
Douglass travelled in the most open manner from Baltimore to New York,
and escaped from a bondage to which he never afterward <a id="returned232"></a>returned.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn232">232</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Fugitives disguised as Whites.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;69. <a id="Fugitives_disguised"></a>Fugitives disguised as whites: Craft case.</b>&mdash;Sometimes the boldest
plans succeeded best if supported by sufficient firmness and presence of
mind. Three negroes possessed of a considerable sum of money once
determined upon a plan, startling in its simplicity and success. They
hired a good travelling coach and horses. They then bribed a white beggar
to dress as a Virginian gentleman, while they mounted the coach
as his driver and footmen; and in this guise they successfully made their
way into <a id="Canada233"></a>Canada.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn233">233</a></sup></p>

<p>Another example of unconcealed flight is found in the often told story of
the escape of William and Ellen Craft, in 1848. They lived in Macon,
Georgia, and were generally well treated. But Ellen had been compelled to
go North with her mistress, and leave her little child at home; during
this absence, the child died uncared for. From that time she determined
to <a id="escape234"></a>escape.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn234">234</a></sup></p>

<p>William at last arranged a plan which was successfully carried out. Ellen
was nearly white. She personated a young Southern planter, while William
accompanied her as her servant. She carried her right arm in a sling so
that she might not be expected to write, bandaged her smooth face, and
put on a pair of green goggles. Thus disguised, she succeeded in buying
tickets for herself and servant without discovery. In the train she was
terrified to see a gentleman who had known her from childhood. He even
sat down by her, and spoke, but to her great relief, he saw in her only a
young invalid going North for his health. From Savannah they took a
steamer to Charleston. There they had some difficulty in passing
inspection, but their most dangerous stopping place was Baltimore, where
every white man with a slave was required to prove his right of property
before he could be allowed to go on to Philadelphia. After some
conversation Ellen told the officer that she knew no one in Baltimore,
and had no proofs that William was her slave; but that he was necessary
to her on account of her illness, and she must take him on. The officer
finally relented, as the train was about to start, and Baltimore was
safely passed.</p>

<p>At Philadelphia shelter was found among the Quakers, and thence they
pushed on to Boston. Here they engaged the attention of Theodore Parker,
and he protected them during their stay. William took up his trade of
cabinet-making, while Ellen added to their income by sewing. They lived
thus quietly until the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850. From
that time, to remain even in Boston was hazardous. Soon after, there
appeared one day in William's shop a man who had worked with him in the
South. He immediately suspected the presence of others, and took refuge
among friends. For two weeks Ellen was with Mr. Parker, who
wrote his sermons during her stay with his sword in a drawer under his
inkstand, and a pistol in his desk.</p>

<p>They were then taken to Mr. Ellis Gray Loring's home. Here William showed
a most honorable spirit. When he found Mr. Loring was not at home he
would not remain, saying, "I am subjecting him to a heavy fine and
imprisonment, and I must go at once to look for some other shelter."</p>

<p>His pursuers, who had come from Georgia, were staying at the United
States Hotel. The knowledge of their object was soon spread abroad, and
they dared not go into the streets for fear of a mob. Handbills, calling
attention to them, were placed everywhere, and cries of "Slave hunters!
there go the slave hunters!" were heard on all sides. At last, they were
absolutely compelled to leave the city. William and Ellen no longer felt
safe, and therefore went to England, where the remainder of their life
was spent in <a id="peace235"></a>peace.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn235">235</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>The Underground Railroad.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;70. Unde<a id="rgro"></a>rground Railroad.</b>&mdash;From the preceding sketch of the conditions
of escape, it is plain that no such numbers as are known to have fled
could possibly have escaped from their masters' power had they depended
solely upon their own exertions. From the beginning of the antislavery
agitation, about 1830, and especially near 1850, a mysterious
organization made it a business to receive, forward, conceal, and protect
fugitives. To that organization the name of "Underground Railroad" was
given, and the many methods used by those connected with it can best be
given under a more elaborate description of the system.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;71. R<a id="ise"></a>ise and growth of the system.</b>&mdash;The first efforts toward any
systematic organization for the aid and protection of fugitive slaves are
found among the Quakers in Pennsylvania. The great number of cases of
kidnapping which occurred in this State after the passage of the law of
1793, by their injustice roused people to action in behalf of the free
blacks; and, their sympathies once enlisted for the colored race, it was
but a step to the aid of the fugitive <a id="negroes236"></a>negroes.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn236">236</a></sup> From this time, as
the number of runaways increased, new agencies were constantly being
established, until from the slave States to Canada a perfect chain of
stations was arranged, not more than one day's journey <a id="apart237"></a>apart.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn237">237</a></sup> The
system is said to have extended from Kentucky and Virginia
across Ohio, and from Maryland, through Pennsylvania and New York, to New
England and <a id="Canada238"></a>Canada.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn238">238</a></sup></p>

<p>As negroes began to disappear, and their masters found themselves unable
to trace them farther than certain towns in Pennsylvania, they said, in
bewilderment, "There must be an Underground Railroad somewhere," and this
expression, suiting the popular fancy, became the general name by which
the whole system was <a id="known239"></a>known.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn239">239</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Operations "Underground."</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;72. Metho<a id="ds_pu"></a>ds pursued.</b>&mdash;Although often varied by circumstances, the
general method of work was always the same. In the South, money was
usually the motive, and for its sake the managers of the Railroad could
usually get some one to aid a slave in escaping and crossing the line. In
the North it was an unselfish, and sometimes dangerous, work of charity.</p>

<p>Fugitives arrived at the first station, ignorant, half-clothed, and
hungry. There they were fed, and, in order to elude the advertisements
sent through the States, disguises were provided. For women, the large
veiled bonnet and plain attire of the Quakeress proved one of the best
costumes. The men received a slip of paper, with a word or two which
would be recognized at the next place, and, unless special caution was
needed, were sent forward on foot. Women and children were often taken in
close carriages, sometimes constructed for this special <a id="purpose240"></a>purpose.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn240">240</a></sup></p>

<p>Stations, that is, the houses of persons known to be interested, were
reached between sunset and ten o'clock in the evening. A tap at the door
would rouse some member of the family, and the fugitive would be taken to
the barn, or some place of <a id="concealment241"></a>concealment.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn241">241</a></sup> Often, too, these houses
were not merely places for a night's tarrying, but homes where the ill
and fatigued might remain and be cared for until strong enough for the
onward <a id="journey242"></a>journey.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn242">242</a></sup></p>

<p>To conduct people over this long line, and to baffle all plans of their
pursuers, required quick wit, as well as great courage and <a id="coolness243"></a>coolness.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn243">243</a></sup>
So successful were the conductors in this respect, however, that a
discouraged slave hunter, after a fruitless search, once said it was "as
easy to find a needle in a haymow as a negro among <a id="Quakers244"></a>Quakers."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn244">244</a></sup></p>

<p> When fugitives were concealed,
and persons desiring to search
the house appeared, it was the custom to receive the searchers
courteously. One of the family immediately engaged them in conversation,
and offered them refreshments. The hunt was thus delayed as long as
possible, so that the fugitive might be helped away. In one case, while
the slave's master was thus entertained upon the front piazza, the
mistress of the house quietly conveyed the hunted negro out at the back
door, and placed him under an inverted hogshead standing by. Then, with
the most unconcerned manner, she allowed the man to search until he was
satisfied that there could be no fugitive in that <a id="house245"></a>house.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn245">245</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;73. Colored agen<a id="ts_of"></a>ts of the Underground Railroad.</b>&mdash;An example of the most
courageous and successful action may be found in the life of Harriet
<a id="Tubman246"></a>Tubman,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn246">246</a></sup> who when a young girl made her escape from slavery alone and
unassisted. After several years of work in the North, she determined to
go back for her family. This trip was safely accomplished, and followed
by others, until during her life she had made nineteen journeys, never
losing a person. The Rev. James Freeman Clarke gives the following
account of her methods:&mdash;</p>



<div class="blockquot">
<p>"She said she first obtained enough money, then went to Maryland, where
she privately collected a party of slaves and got them ready to start.
She satisfied herself that they had enough courage and firmness to run
the risks. For if once a negro entered her party, there was no falling
back. Fully determined herself, she would allow no one to return.</p>

<p>"She next made arrangements so that they should set out Saturday night,
as there would be no opportunity on Sunday for advertising them, so that
they had that day's start on their way North. Then she had places
prepared where she could be sure that they could be protected and taken
care of, if she had the money to pay for that protection. When she was at
the North, she tried to raise funds until she got a certain amount, and
then went South to carry out this plan. She always paid some colored man
to follow after the person who put up the posters advertising the
runaway, and pull them down as fast as they were put <a id="up247"></a>up."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn247">247</a></sup></p>
</div>




<p>When she feared the party were closely pursued, she would take them for a
time on a train southward bound, as no one seeing a company of
negroes going in this direction would for an instant suppose them to be
fugitives. As their leader out of bondage, her people gave her the name
of "Moses," and thus she is generally known.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;74. Prosecutions o<a id="f_age"></a>f agents.</b>&mdash;Such
acts as those daily performed by the
conductors on the Underground Railroad could not be carried on under the
existing laws without leading to prosecutions. Large rewards were many
times offered for Harriet's capture, but she eluded all efforts to stop
her work. At one time the Maryland legislature offered a reward to any
person who should secure Thomas Garrett in any public jail in the State.
He was a Delaware Quaker, who, it is said, helped twenty-nine hundred
slaves in escaping. The Governor was required to employ the best legal
skill to prosecute him on the charge of aiding <a id="runaways248"></a>runaways.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn248">248</a></sup> He was
afterward tried and fined a sum which consumed his entire property. As
this was paid, the officer who received it said that he hoped the
remembrance of this punishment would prevent any further trouble. Mr.
Garrett, undaunted, replied that they had taken all that he possessed,
but added, "If thee knows any poor fugitive who wants a breakfast, send
him to <a id="me249"></a>me."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn249">249</a></sup> In fact, he seemed absolutely fearless. Angry
slaveholders often called upon him, and demanded their property. He never
denied knowledge of their slaves, or of having helped them on their way,
but, in the most quiet manner, positively refused to give information
concerning <a id="them250"></a>them.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn250">250</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;75. <a id="Formal"></a>Formal organization.</b>&mdash;In
 1838 the first formal organization of the
Underground Railroad was made, with Robert Purvis as President. It was
said that two marketwomen in Baltimore were their best helpers. They had
come into possession of a number of passports, or "freedoms," which were
used by slaves for part of the distance, and then were returned to serve
the same purpose <a id="again251"></a>again.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn251">251</a></sup></p>

<p>In all transactions connected with this organization the greatest secrecy
was necessarily observed, seldom more than two or three persons at a
station being allowed any knowledge of it. In the Liberator of 1843, a
notice is found cautioning people against exposing in any way the methods
used by fugitives in escaping, as it only helped the pursuers in
the next case. The fugitives themselves were usually careful in this
respect. Frederick Douglass absolutely refused until after the abolition
of slavery to reveal the method of his <a id="escape252"></a>escape.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn252">252</a></sup></p>

<p>Mrs. G. S. Hillard, of Boston, was in the habit of putting fugitives in
an upper room of her house. A colored man was placed there, and when Mrs.
Hillard went up to see him, she found he had carefully pulled down all
the shades at the windows. She told him that there was no danger of his
being seen from the street. "Perhaps not, Missis," he replied, "but I do
not want to spoil the place." He was afraid lest some one might see a
colored face there, and so excite suspicions injurious to the next
<a id="man253"></a>man.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn253">253</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;76. G<a id="enera"></a>eneral effect of escapes.</b>&mdash;Although many fugitives were aided
previous to 1850, it was after the new law went into effect that the
great efforts of the Abolitionists were centred on this form of
assistance. Of such importance did it become, that at the beginning of
the Civil War one of the chief complaints of the Southern States was the
injury received through the aid given their escaping slaves by the
<a id="North254"></a>North.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn254">254</a></sup></p>

<p>It was, however, really the "safety valve to the institution of slavery.
As soon as leaders arose among the slaves who refused to endure the yoke,
they would go North. Had they remained, there must have been enacted at
the South the direful scenes of San <a id="Domingo255"></a>Domingo."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn255">255</a></sup></p>

</div>

<p><b>§&nbsp;77. Chara<a id="cter"></a>cter of the personal liberty laws.</b>&mdash;The personal liberty laws
were statutes passed in the Northern States whose object was to defeat in
some measure the national Fugitive Slave Law. Often their ostensible
purpose was to protect the free negroes from kidnappers, and to this end
they secured for the alleged fugitive the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus, and the trial by jury. Sometimes, however, they frankly avowed
their aim as a deliberate attempt to interfere with the execution of the
United States statutes. In the following examination of these laws, they
will be considered first chronologically, and afterward more minutely
according to their subject matter. In previous chapters we have noticed
many instances wherein fugitives have been befriended by individuals, or
by organizations like the Antislavery Societies or the Underground
Railroad. But the action of the State governments in the personal liberty
bills, from the time the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 began to be executed
to the outbreak of the Civil War, showed that the dissatisfaction of the
North was fundamental, and was not confined merely to the few in the van
of the Antislavery movement.</p>

<h3><span>Analysis.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;78. Acts <a id="pass"></a>passed before the Prigg
decision (1793-1842).</b>&mdash;Although the
so-called personal liberty laws were not passed until about 1840,
<a id="Indiana256"></a>Indiana<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn256">256</a></sup> and <a id="Connecticut257"></a>Connecticut<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn257">257</a></sup> had before that time provided that on
appeal fugitives might have a trial by jury. The Connecticut law, in
contrast to the hostile spirit of later legislation, was entitled,
 "An Act for the fulfilment of the obligation of this State
imposed by the Constitution of the United States in regard to persons
held to service or labor in one State escaping into another, and to
secure the right of trial by jury in the cases herein mentioned."
Notwithstanding this preamble, the law provided for fining State
officials who might take part in fugitive slave cases.</p>

<p>The first definite personal liberty laws were passed by <a id="Vermont258"></a>Vermont<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn258">258</a></sup> and
New <a id="York259"></a>York,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn259">259</a></sup> in 1840, and were entitled Acts "to extend the right of
trial by jury." They not only insured jury trial, but also provided
attorneys to defend fugitives. This was the only law of the kind New York
ever passed, and proved of little value, since it soon fell into disuse,
and was almost forgotten.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;79. Acts pa<a id="ssed"></a>ssed between the Prigg decision and the second Fugitive
Slave Law (1842-1850).</b>&mdash;After the Prigg decision in 1842, wherein it was
declared that the law must be executed through national powers only, and
that State authorities could not be forced into <a id="action260"></a>action,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn260">260</a></sup> a new class
of statutes sprang up. The State legislatures seized the opportunity
afforded them by Judge Story's opinion, to forbid State officers from
performing the duties required of them by the law of 1793, and prohibited
the use of State jails in fugitive slave cases. Such laws were passed in
<a id="Massachusetts261"></a>Massachusetts,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn261">261</a></sup> <a id="Vermont262"></a>Vermont,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn262">262</a></sup> <a id="Pennsylvania263"></a>Pennsylvania,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn263">263</a></sup> and Rhode
<a id="Island264"></a>Island.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn264">264</a></sup> In 1844, Connecticut repealed her act of 1838, as being then
unconstitutional, but retained the portion forbidding State officers to
participate in the execution of the law.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;80. Acts <a id="occa"></a>occasioned by the law of 1850 (1850-1860).</b>&mdash;The provisions of
the law of 1850 roused yet more opposition in the North, and before 1856
many of the States had passed personal liberty bills. The new national
law avoided the employment of State officers. This change in the statute
brought about a corresponding alteration in the State legislation, and we
therefore find the acts of this period differing somewhat from those of
earlier years. They almost invariably prohibited the use of State jails,
they often forbade State judges and officers to issue writs or to give
assistance to the claimant, and punished severely the seizure of a free
person with the intent to reduce him to slavery.</p>

<p>Should an alleged fugitive be arrested, the personal liberty
acts were intended to secure him a trial surrounded by the usual legal
safeguards. The identity of the person claimed was to be proved by two
witnesses; or they gave him the right to a writ of habeas corpus; or they
enjoined upon the court to which the writ was returnable a trial by jury.
At the trial the prisoner must be defended by an attorney, frequently the
State or county attorney, and a penalty was provided for false testimony.
Any violation of these clauses by State officers was punished by
penalties varying from five hundred dollars and six months in jail, as in
Pennsylvania, to the maximum punishment in Vermont, of two thousand
dollars' fine and ten years in prison.</p>

<p>Such acts were passed in <a id="Vermont265"></a>Vermont,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn265">265</a></sup> <a id="Connecticut266"></a>Connecticut,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn266">266</a></sup> and Rhode

laws were also enacted in <a id="Wisconsin271"></a>Wisconsin,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn271">271</a></sup> <a id="Kansas272"></a>Kansas,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn272">272</a></sup> <a id="Ohio273"></a>Ohio,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn273">273</a></sup> and
<a id="Pennsylvania274"></a>Pennsylvania.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn274">274</a></sup> Of the other Northern States, two only, New Jersey and
California, gave any official sanction to the rendition of fugitives. In
New Hampshire, New York, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota, however,
no full personal liberty laws were <a id="passed275"></a>passed.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn275">275</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;81. M<a id="assach"></a>assachusetts acts.</b>&mdash;Let us now examine the purport of these acts
in the various States. The general tenor and effect are best seen in
Massachusetts, which may be selected as a typical State. In
1837, Massachusetts passed a law "to restore the trial by jury, on
questions of personal freedom." This secured to the prisoner a writ of
personal replevin, which was to be issued from and returnable to the
Court of Common Pleas for the county in which the plaintiff was confined,
and was to be issued fourteen days at least before the return day. If the
prisoner were secreted, the court might send out a capias to take the
body of the defendant. This act allowed an appeal to the Supreme Judicial
Court.</p>

<p>In 1842, the Latimer <a id="case276"></a>case<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn276">276</a></sup> occurred. This so aroused public sentiment
that a great petition, signed by sixty-five thousand people, was sent to
the legislature, asking for a new personal liberty law. On the basis of
the Prigg decision, a law was enacted which forbade State magistrates to
issue certificates or take cognizance of the law of 1793, and withheld
the use of State jails for the imprisonment of <a id="fugitives277"></a>fugitives.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn277">277</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1851, in the Shadrach <a id="case278"></a>case,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn278">278</a></sup> there was opportunity for testing the
value of this law. The fugitive was not indeed confined in any jail, but
there was little difficulty in providing a place of detention, and the
court-house was secured. In this year, acting upon a clause in the
Governor's message, which treated of the new Fugitive Slave Law of 1850,
a committee in the legislature made a report, accompanied by resolutions
and a bill further to protect personal liberty; but no law was passed,
and there the matter rested <a id="until279"></a>until 1855.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn279">279</a></sup></p>

<p>After the <a id="Sims280"></a>Sims<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn280">280</a></sup> and <a id="Burns281"></a>Burns<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn281">281</a></sup> cases, in which the court-houses were
again used in the place of jails, the heat of public indignation led to
petitions to the legislature asking for a more stringent personal liberty
law. A joint committee prepared a bill, which was passed, but was vetoed
by Governor Gardner, who had been advised by the Attorney General that
some of the clauses were unconstitutional. But so strong was the
influence in its favor that it was passed over the veto by a two-thirds
<a id="vote282"></a>vote.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn282">282</a></sup> The feeling that it was probably unconstitutional, however,
must have strengthened in the next three years: for <a id="in283"></a>in 1858<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn283">283</a></sup> we find
another act which amended the act of 1855. This limited some
provisions, and repealed the following sections: the tenth, which
required that any person who should give a certificate that a person
claimed as a fugitive was a slave should forfeit any State office he
might hold; the eleventh, which forbade any person acting as attorney for
a claimant to appear as counsel or attorney in the State courts; the
twelfth, which made a violation of the preceding section sufficient
ground for the impeachment of any officer of the Commonwealth; the
thirteenth, which forbade any United States officer empowered to give
certificate or issue warrants from holding a State office; and the
fourteenth, which made liable to removal any person holding a State
judicial office who should also hold the office of Commissioner.</p>




<h3><span>Review of the Acts by States.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;82. Revi<a id="ew_of"></a>ew of the acts by States.</b>&mdash;Of the other New England States,
Maine had no personal liberty law <a id="until284"></a>until 1855.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn284">284</a></sup> Two years after,
however, <a id="in285"></a>in 1857,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn285">285</a></sup> a portion of an act declaring free all slaves
brought by their masters into that State was devoted to a provision "to
punish any attempt to exercise authority over them."</p>

<p>In New Hampshire, one of the laws <a id="of286"></a>of 1857<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn286">286</a></sup> enacted that every person
holding any person as a slave for any length of time, under any pretence,
should be deemed guilty of felony; but provided that this should not
apply to United States officers executing any legal process.</p>

<p>Vermont, by an act <a id="in287"></a>in 1840,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn287">287</a></sup> extended to fugitives the right of trial
by jury, but after three years this was <a id="repealed288"></a>repealed,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn288">288</a></sup> only to be renewed
<a id="in289"></a>in 1850.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn289">289</a></sup></p>

<p>Connecticut, as has been noticed, had no personal liberty law. Rhode
Island first passed such an act <a id="in290"></a>in 1848.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn290">290</a></sup> This forbade State officers
to take cognizance of fugitive slave cases, and the use of State jails.
Another statute, in 1854,<sup class="topnum"><a id="in291"></a><a href="#fn291">291</a></sup> extended these provisions so as to apply
to the national law of 1850.</p>

<p>The act of 1840 was the only Personal Liberty Law of New <a id="York292"></a>York.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn292">292</a></sup>
Pennsylvania, some seven years later, forbade the use of jails, and
punished State officers for participating in fugitive slave <a id="cases293"></a>cases.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn293">293</a></sup> It
 also enacted a regulation of the same character as late as
1860.</p>

<p>Ohio made but one provision on the subject, and that lasted but a year.
Her jails were closed to suspected slaves <a id="in294"></a>in 1857,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn294">294</a></sup> but in 1858 this
law was <a id="repealed295"></a>repealed.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn295">295</a></sup></p>

<p>Michigan passed such an act <a id="in296"></a>in 1855,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn296">296</a></sup> with the usual clauses on the
use of jails and jury trial, and imposed a fine on false testimony
against the defendant.</p>

<p>In 1858 Wisconsin and Kansas also passed similar <a id="acts297"></a>acts.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn297">297</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;83. Effe<a id="ct_of"></a>ct of the personal liberty laws.</b>&mdash;Since the avowed purpose of
these laws was to obstruct the execution of one of the United States
statutes, national and State legislation were thus brought into direct
conflict; but the Fugitive Slave Law was held constitutional by the
Supreme Court, and any attempt to prevent its enforcement by positive
means, however righteous from an ethical standpoint, must be considered
an infraction of the Constitution, and of the common understanding
between the States, on which the Union was <a id="founded298"></a>founded.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn298">298</a></sup> The provisions
denying the use of State institutions and officers, though distinctly
unfriendly, were not unconstitutional. Many of the Abolitionists,
however, held the national law to be unconstitutional, and at the same
time morally so repugnant that it ought never to be <a id="executed299"></a>executed.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn299">299</a></sup> The
State laws were brought up by South Carolina, in her declaration of the
causes of secession, as one of the chief grievances against the North;
and President Buchanan, in his Message <a id="of300"></a>of 1860,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn300">300</a></sup> said they were "the
most palpable violations of constitutional duty which had yet been
committed." They must certainly be classed in principle with the
Nullification Ordinance of 1832. Indeed, the legislature of Wisconsin,
after the Supreme Court had overridden the decision of the State courts
in the case of Ableman v. Booth that the national law was contrary to the
national Constitution, passed some resolutions in which a "positive
defiance is urged as the 'rightful remedy'" against such
<a id="legislation301"></a>legislation.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn301">301</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;85. The Fugitive Slave Law in the <a id="crisis_of_1860"></a>crisis of 1860-61.</b>&mdash;If the number of
interesting fugitive slave cases falls off in the latter part of the
decade from 1850 to 1860, it is not because the law was better enforced,
but because it was little enforced. The continued interference of the
friends of the slave had proved that a fugitive could not safely be
recovered in Massachusetts, and that no punishment could be secured for
those who helped him to his freedom. The personal liberty bills added
serious legal obstacles. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin even went so far
as to declare the national act of 1850 <a id="unconstitutional302"></a>unconstitutional.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn302">302</a></sup> In 1859
John Brown, in his Harper's Ferry raid, attempted to establish a centre
to which fugitives might flock; and although he was defeated, he
had the sympathy of a large number of persons in the North, including
some public men.</p>

<p>In the violent debates of 1860-61, one of the frequent charges brought by
the southern members against the North was its persistent refusal to
execute the Fugitive Slave Act, or to permit it to be <a id="executed303"></a>executed.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn303">303</a></sup> Even
Republican members disclaimed responsibility for their party, and urged
that the personal liberty bills should be <a id="repealed304"></a>repealed.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn304">304</a></sup> Other bolder
spirits seized the opportunity to urge a repeal of the act, and in the
various compromise propositions introduced were several attempts to
modify the existing constitutional provision on the subject.</p>




<h3><span>Enforcement. Slaves of Disloyal Men.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;86. <a id="Propositions_to_enforce"></a>Propositions to enforce the Fugitive Slave Law.</b>&mdash;In the crisis of
1860 the South seemed to expect a general settlement of the slavery
question like that of 1850, and therefore demanded a more effective act
for the return of fugitives. President Buchanan, in his message of
December 4, 1860, recommended "explanatory" constitutional amendments
which should recognize the master's right to the recovery of his fugitive
slaves, and the validity of the Fugitive Slave Law. He recommended also a
declaration against State laws impairing the right of the master, as
being violations of the Constitution, and consequently null and
<a id="void305"></a>void.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn305">305</a></sup> This recommendation was followed, December 12, 1860, by no
less than eleven resolutions upon the subject in the <a id="House306"></a>House.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn306">306</a></sup> Of these
five were constitutional amendments. Several provided, as a pacific
measure, that the town, county, or State, guilty of neglect to return a
fugitive, might be sued by the owner of the slave for the amount thus
lost to <a id="him307"></a>him.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn307">307</a></sup> The most arbitrary proposition was that of Mr. Hindman.
It denied representation in Congress to any State which should hold in
force laws hindering the delivery of <a id="fugitives308"></a>fugitives.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn308">308</a></sup></p>

<p>Another resolution inquired into the expediency of declaring it felony to resist an officer of the United States in the execution of the
law, or to attempt to rescue a <a id="runaway309"></a>runaway.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn309">309</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;87. Propositions to <a id="repeal_or_amend"></a>repeal or amend the law.</b>&mdash;On the other hand,
antislavery members insisted that the provision for the return of
fugitives was already too severe; but only one of the resolutions
proposed any amendment in favor of the slave. Mr. Kilgore proposed to
give a trial by jury before a fugitive should be <a id="returned310"></a>returned.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn310">310</a></sup></p>



<p>As early as 1860 Mr. Blake had introduced into the House a bill to repeal
the law of 1850. It was read twice, and referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary, from whom it was never <a id="reported311"></a>reported.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn311">311</a></sup> At that time Congress,
in alarm at the state of the country, was vainly striving to mend matters
by making the Fugitive Slave Law even more effective. March 1, 1861, the
select committee of thirty-three brought in a bill for the amendment of
the law of 1850; it allowed an appeal to the Circuit Court of the United
States where jury trial was to be given. The bill passed the House the
same day; but in the Senate it never got beyond the first <a id="reading312"></a>reading.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn312">312</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;88. <a id="The_q"></a>The question of slaves of rebels.</b>&mdash;With the beginning of the Civil
War in 1861 the last period in the study of fugitive slaves opens, to
close only with the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Law and the abolition of
slavery.</p>

<p>New conditions now surrounded the slaves. Their masters were away in the
army; many homes were broken up, and confusion reigned instead of law;
the strict discipline and oversight necessary for the maintenance of the
slave system was impossible. Opportunities for escape occurred everywhere
and at all times. Since war had brought the Northern people down into
their own land, the slave no longer needed to travel hundreds of miles to
find friends; the Northern camps were perhaps but a few miles from his
own plantation. In this way negroes began to gather around the Federal
camps in such numbers that the question of disposing of them became
serious. If the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 were considered as still
binding, their apprehension and return were necessary; but many of the
masters were in arms against the government; should they still be
protected in their property? The belligerent position of the
South seemed to preclude any right on the part of disloyal owners to ask
for the benefit of the law.</p>

<p>To meet the changed conditions no policy had as yet been developed by the
government. The first solution of the problem was made at Fortress Monroe
by General Butler. He drew an analogy from international law, which makes
material of war imported into the country of a belligerent lawful prize
to the army or navy of the other belligerent. Regarded as property, the
slaves of rebels could be of great service to them, and of equal help to
the government in suppressing rebellion. Regarded as persons, they had
escaped from communities where rebellion was in progress, and they asked
protection from the government to which they were still loyal. In May,
1861, General Butler therefore replied to all demands for fugitives that
he should retain them as "contraband of war." The answer was widely
spread, and "contraband" became the name by which such negroes were
<a id="known313"></a>known.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn313">313</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;89. Slave<a id="ry_at"></a>ry attacked in Congress.</b>&mdash;A series of attacks upon slavery now
began in Congress. To many persons the fact that the institution was
recognized in the Constitution seemed sufficient ground for protecting
it. No doubt was entertained of the power of Congress to confiscate the
ordinary property of rebels; but such persons deprecated all interference
with slaves, who were supposed to possess a kind of constitutional
immunity, wholly unknown to and above all other <a id="property314"></a>property.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn314">314</a></sup> In the
minds of antislavery men, "no greater fallacy was ever asserted than this
attempt thus to link 'the institution' and the Constitution indissolubly
together, to engraft the former upon the latter, to make slavery the
corner stone of the nation, to be guarded and protected by the
<a id="government315"></a>government."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn315">315</a></sup> Nevertheless, the existence of slavery in the Border
States which had remained loyal made Congress very cautious as to general
enactments. On the other hand, no form of property held by rebels was so
vulnerable; slaves could not only be seized as the lines of the Northern
troops extended, they could, by actual law or by kindly reception, be
invited across the lines. Both the passions aroused by civil war and a
humane pity for the slave urged the government to deprive the master
engaged in secession of the services of his slave.</p>




<h3><span>Confiscation Bills.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;90. <a id="Confiscation_bills"></a>Confiscation bills.</b>&mdash;July 18, 1861, Mr. Chandler and Mr. Trumbull
introduced general confiscation bills in the Senate; they were both
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. In the discussion Mr.
Trumbull offered as an amendment "that whenever any person claiming to be
entitled to the service or labor of any other person, under the laws of
any State, shall employ such person in aiding or promoting any
insurrection, or in resisting the laws of the United States, or shall
permit or suffer him to be so employed, he shall forfeit all right to
such service or labor, and the person whose service or labor is thus
claimed shall be thenceforth discharged therefrom, any law to the
contrary <a id="notwithstanding316"></a>notwithstanding."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn316">316</a></sup></p>

<p>The proposition aroused considerable opposition, since it was a step far
in advance of anything which had yet been done against the interests of
slavery, and any proposition which advocated "an act of emancipation,"
however limited and qualified, was the signal for hot discussion. The
opposing party announced that "nothing will come of it but more
<a id="irritation317"></a>irritation,"<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn317">317</a></sup> and in each crisis statesmen should "observe all
possible toleration, all conciliation, all <a id="liberality318"></a>liberality."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn318">318</a></sup> Mr. Wilson
upheld the opposite opinion, and thought that the time had come when this
government, and the men who are in arms under the government, should
cease to return their fugitive slaves to traitors.</p>

<p>The bill passed the Senate July 22, 1861. In the House it was amended so
as to limit the negroes to be freed more strictly to those employed in
military <a id="service319"></a>service.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn319">319</a></sup> The bill went back to the Senate, which concurred
in the <a id="amendment320"></a>amendment,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn320">320</a></sup> and it received the signature of the President,
<a id="August321"></a>August 6, 1861.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn321">321</a></sup></p>





<h3><span>The Emancipation Proclamation.</span></h3>


<p><b>§&nbsp;91. Confiscation <a id="provisions_extended"></a>provisions extended.</b>&mdash;Propositions more far reaching
were introduced into the Senate in the session <a id="of322"></a>of 1861-62.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn322">322</a></sup> January
15, 1862, Mr. Trumbull, from the Committee on the Judiciary, to whom the
various propositions had been referred, reported an original bill, and
asked that the committee be discharged from the consideration of
<a id="others323"></a>others.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn323">323</a></sup> March 14, 1862, Mr. Harris introduced into the
Senate a bill to confiscate the property of rebels and for other
<a id="purposes324"></a>purposes.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn324">324</a></sup> These propositions were considered at length, but never
came to a vote. It is not necessary to enter here into the discussion of
confiscations and of the constitutional right of Congress to free the
slaves; in most of the bills there was a provision against the return of
slaves to disloyal masters.</p>

<p>The Harris bill declared that, before any order for the surrender of
fugitives should be given, the claimant must establish not only his title
to the slave, as was then provided by law, but also that he is and has
been loyal to the United States during the Rebellion. Mr. Pomeroy
objected to this because it would make it "obligatory on the government
of the United States to surrender a person claimed to be indebted to
another for service or labor, if the claimant proves that he is loyal to
the government. Would not this re-enact the Fugitive Slave Law <a id="of325"></a>of
1850?"<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn325">325</a></sup> An amendment was therefore adopted which so changed the law
that any reference to the act of 1850 was <a id="avoided326"></a>avoided.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn326">326</a></sup> After several
debates the proposition was recommitted, <a id="May327"></a>May 6.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn327">327</a></sup> Mr. Clark reported a
bill, May 14, which retained the provision in regard to fugitives as at
first <a id="offered328"></a>offered.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn328">328</a></sup></p>

<p>In the House, resolutions on confiscation and emancipation were offered
on the first day of the session, but the final action was based upon one
of several bills introduced by Mr. Eliot, <a id="May329"></a>May 14, 1862.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn329">329</a></sup> His first
bill, upon the confiscation of the property of the rebels, need not be
followed out here; but the second bill provided for the emancipation of
the slaves of disloyal masters, and forbade their return as fugitives.
After various <a id="recommitments330"></a>recommitments<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn330">330</a></sup> a bill was brought in, according to
which, in any suit brought by a claimant to recover the possession of
slaves to enforce such service or labor, it was to be a sufficient bar to
allege and prove that the master was disloyal to the <a id="government331"></a>government.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn331">331</a></sup> The
bill then passed the House by a vote of 82 <a id="to332"></a>to 54.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn332">332</a></sup></p>


<p>When it came up in the Senate, June 23, 1862, Mr. Clark moved to
strike out all after the enacting clause, and to insert a substitute
which would again unite the confiscation and emancipation bills. This
amendment was rejected by the House, and a conference committee was
appointed which reported July 11 and 12. The fugitive from a disloyal
master was by this compromise to be deemed a captive of war, and forever
freed from <a id="servitude333"></a>servitude.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn333">333</a></sup> The report was adopted by both houses, and
approved by the President, <a id="July334"></a>July 17, 1862.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn334">334</a></sup> From that date any slave
of a disloyal master who could make his way into the territory occupied
by the Northern troops was <i>ipso facto</i> free. The fugitive was to become
a freeman.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;92. Effect of <a id="the_E"></a>the Emancipation Proclamation (1863).</b>&mdash;The complete
emancipation of the negroes within the Confederate lines was the next
logical step, and was demanded as a war measure. It deprived the
Confederacy of the aid of these slaves, and at the same time made it
possible to arm and employ the former slaves against their masters.
September 22, 1862, President Lincoln issued his preliminary
proclamation, by which he warned the South that, unless it should return
to its allegiance, all persons held as slaves in the States in rebellion
on the 1st of January, 1863, should be "thenceforth and forever free."</p>

<p>At the end of one hundred days the final and absolute Proclamation was
put forth, January 1, 1863. It declared also that negroes might be
received into the armed service of the United States; and henceforth
throughout the war, the former slaves were enrolled as soldiers and did
good service for the government.</p>

<p>The effect of this proclamation was to end slavery, and with it the
return of fugitives, within the Confederate lines. But here the legal
machinery of the government had no effect; the State laws relating to
slavery might be considered suspended, but practically the laws and
practices of the Confederacy prevailed. On the other hand, the Fugitive
Slave Law yet existed upon the statute-book where the Union had power;
the arrest and imprisonment of fugitives was yet legal, and many desired
to see the law repealed as another step toward the final crushing out of
the system.</p>



<h3><span>Fugitives from Loyal Slave States.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;93. Fugitives <a id="in_lo"></a>in loyal slave States.</b>&mdash;From the beginning of the war one
of the most embarrassing questions which had come before Congress was,
How shall the slaves of loyal owners be treated? The necessity of holding
the Border States firm for the Union disposed many to support
only the most conciliatory measures; but these States were a part of the
theatre of war. Northern armies now occupied parts of the Confederacy as
well, and among the great numbers of blacks who flocked to the Union camp
it was impossible to separate the slaves of the loyal from the disloyal.
Moreover, it was necessary that there should be some uniformity of
method. Without specific law, the reception given to fugitives from loyal
masters must vary with the views of each commanding officer with whom
they sought refuge.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;94. T<a id="ypic"></a>ypical cases.</b>&mdash;Cases began to occur very early in the struggle. In
1861 a slave called Wisdom ran away from Georgetown, and was taken in by
some wagoners belonging to the Northern army. He soon found work, but his
master succeeded in tracing him, and came to camp to claim him. He
demanded the slave of Captain Swan, officer of the day. Captain Swan
hoped the man might be smuggled away, and so delayed the search as long
as possible. The master then went to Colonel Cowden, who immediately
ordered the slave to be surrendered, without the form of proceedings
prescribed by the act of 1850, and in disregard of the fact that the
master was not provided with the necessary certificate. When the facts
became known in Massachusetts and elsewhere, there was great indignation.
The Colonel was hung in effigy in Boston, with the following inscription:
"Colonel Cowden, of Burns rendition notoriety, is now practising his
tricks at kidnapping in <a id="Washington335"></a>Washington."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn335">335</a></sup></p>

<p>Major Sherwood of the 11th West Virginia Regiment had, in 1861, employed
a colored refugee as his servant. The owner sent a United States marshal
to Brigadier General Boyle, who gave an order for his rendition. Major
Sherwood sent a message that he would give up his sword, but, while he
was in command, no fugitive should be returned. He was placed under
arrest for disobedience, to await court-martial; but General Staunton
ordered General Boyle's order revoked, and Major Sherwood was never
tried. In the mean time the boy had been sent away concealed under the
seat of an ambulance, and reached Canada in <a id="safety336"></a>safety.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn336">336</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;95. Question <a id="discussed_in_Congress"></a>discussed in Congress.</b>&mdash;As early in the war as 1861, a
number of resolutions were brought into Congress, designed to meet this
<a id="difficulty337"></a>difficulty,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn337">337</a></sup> and Mr. Lovejoy introduced a bill making it a penal offence "for any officer or private of the army or navy to capture
or return, or aid in the capture or return" of fugitive <a id="slaves338"></a>slaves.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn338">338</a></sup> The
bill was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, which reported
adversely upon it, <a id="April339"></a>April 16, 1862.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn339">339</a></sup> December 16, 1861, Mr. Hale had
offered a resolution, which was adopted, looking toward a uniform method
of dealing with the slaves of <a id="rebels340"></a>rebels.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn340">340</a></sup> Mr. Sumner brought in another
on December 17, which forbade the employment of the armies in the
surrender of <a id="fugitives341"></a>fugitives.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn341">341</a></sup> "I ask, sir," said the writer of a letter
read by Mr. Sumner, "shall our sons, who are offering their lives for the
preservation of our institutions, be degraded to slave catchers for any
persons loyal or disloyal? If such is the policy of the government, I
shall urge my son to shed no more blood for its <a id="preservation342"></a>preservation."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn342">342</a></sup>
Another protest came from two German companies in one of the
Massachusetts regiments, who, when they enlisted, entered the service
with the understanding that they should not be put to any such
discreditable service. They complained, and with them the German
population generally throughout the <a id="country343"></a>country.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn343">343</a></sup></p>

<p>Some proof that the owner of the slave was at least loyal to the
government seemed necessary, if rendition were to be made at all; though
antislavery men were determined to admit no return of fugitives under any
circumstances. December 20, 1861, a resolution of Mr. Wilson's was
adopted, for an additional article of war forbidding officers from
returning fugitives under any <a id="consideration344"></a>consideration.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn344">344</a></sup> A bill was introduced,
discussed, and somewhat amended, but never <a id="passed345"></a>passed.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn345">345</a></sup></p>

<p>Mr. Blair's bill, of February 25, 1862, from the Committee on Military
Affairs in the House, was to the same <a id="purpose346"></a>purpose.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn346">346</a></sup> This, however, was
successfully carried in both houses, and signed by the President, May 14,
1862. In the discussion, Mr. Mallory opposed the bill, because it seemed
to him that it would prevent the President of the United States from
sending a military force into a State to aid the authorities in enforcing
a national law which stands upon the statute-<a id="book347"></a>book.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn347">347</a></sup> Mr. Bingham
answered this objection by saying that it simply determined that for the
future, as in the past, the army and navy should not exercise
functions which belong solely to the civil <a id="magistrates348"></a>magistrates.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn348">348</a></sup></p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;96. Arrests by <a id="civil_officers"></a>civil officers.</b>&mdash;The act of May 14, 1862, applied only
to army officers. Notwithstanding the opportunities then offered for
escape, wandering negroes were still liable to be seized by civil
authorities and placed in jail. In this way numbers of negroes, many of
them really free, were arrested, on the supposition of being runaways,
and were imprisoned without trial for an indefinite length of time. An
advertisement in 1863 shows the method then in use.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p> "There was committed to the jail of Warren County, Kentucky, as a
    runaway slave, on the 29th September, 1862, a negro man calling
    himself Jo Miner. He says he is free, but has nothing to show to
    establish the fact. He is about thirty-five years of age, very dark
    copper color, about five feet eight inches high, and will weigh about
    one hundred and fifty pounds. The owner can come forward, prove
    property, and pay charges, or he will be dealt with as the law
    requires.</p>

<h3><span>District of Columbia.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;97. Denial  of the use of the <a id="jails_in_the_District"></a>jails in the District of
Columbia.</b>&mdash;Several efforts were made to remedy this state of things, at
least in the territory over which Congress had exclusive control.
December 4, 1861, Mr. Wilson, who had been investigating the condition of
the District of Columbia jail in Washington, offered a joint resolution
for the release of all fugitives from service or labor therein <a id="held350"></a>held.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn350">350</a></sup>
It appeared that some sixty persons were imprisoned solely because they
were suspected of being runaways, and had been allowed no opportunity to
prove the contrary. A free boy from Pennsylvania came to Washington with
the 5th Pennsylvania Regiment. He was found in the streets and sent to
jail. Another boy, who was working for the soldiers on the railroad, was
also taken up and placed <a id="there351"></a>there.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn351">351</a></sup></p>

<p>Mr. Wilson struck at the root of the matter by a resolution, which was
agreed to, looking to the revision of all the laws in the District of
Columbia providing for the arrest of persons as fugitives from service or
labor, and to consider the expediency of abolishing slavery in the
<a id="District352"></a>District.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn352">352</a></sup></p>

<p>On December 9, 1861, Mr. Bingham introduced a resolution for the
repeal of all acts in force in the District of Columbia which authorized
the commitment of runaways and suspected runaways to the jail; it was
referred to the Committee on the <a id="Judiciary353"></a>Judiciary.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn353">353</a></sup> Mr. Fessenden asked that
the Committee on the District of Columbia investigate and report upon the
condition of the jail; this was agreed <a id="to354"></a>to.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn354">354</a></sup></p>

<p>A few weeks later, December 30, 1861, Mr. Grimes presented a bill in the
Senate in regard to the administration of criminal justice in the
District. This was read and referred to the committee, which reported it,
<a id="January355"></a>January 6, 1862.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn355">355</a></sup> Efforts were immediately made to prevent fugitive
slaves from being included in the general jail delivery contemplated by
the bill. Mr. Powell, in the debate upon his amendment to that purpose,
urged that so long as the institution of slavery existed in the South, no
such measure ought to <a id="prevail356"></a>prevail.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn356">356</a></sup> Mr. Grimes supported his measure by
giving some examples of exceedingly unjust cases which had occurred. "A
young colored fellow, who came as a servant of an officer from the
vicinity of Pittsburg, was thrown into this jail in August last. The
regiment to which he was attached went forward toward the face of the
enemy. There was nobody here to look after him. There is no doubt as to
his being a free boy, yet he was there on the first day of this month."
To such cases he desired to have the law apply. "They have here in this
District and in Maryland what they call an apprehension fee. They have a
law which declares that if any slave wanders a certain distance from the
residence of his master, he may be taken up as a fugitive. There are
persons in this vicinity, I am credibly informed, who are lying in wait
all around your city and the surrounding country, in hope that they can
find some poor colored man or woman who is out picking berries and
visiting a friend, and who will wander a little further than the distance
established by law from the residence of the <a id="master357"></a>master."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn357">357</a></sup> The opinion
that such injustice ought to be corrected prevailed, and the amendment
was rejected. After much discussion the bill passed the Senate, <a id="January358"></a>January
14, 1862,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn358">358</a></sup> and it was approved by the President on the same day.
Thenceforward the Fugitive Slave Law was practically a dead letter at the
seat of government, since the necessary machinery was lacking,
and the spirit of the administration was opposed to it. The new act was
in effect a national personal liberty bill.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;98. Abolition of slavery in the District of Colum<a id="bia"></a>bia.</b>&mdash;The work
contemplated by all the propositions was finally accomplished in one act.
On December 16, 1861, Mr. Wilson had offered a bill in the Senate for the
total abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. It was reported
with amendments a few weeks after the passage of the act denying the use
of jails, and on February 24, 1862, Mr. Wilson presented a supplementary
<a id="bill359"></a>bill.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn359">359</a></sup></p>

<p>The debates upon this proposition were long and interesting. The South
regarded it as "an entering wedge of something more comprehensive and
<a id="radical360"></a>radical,"<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn360">360</a></sup> as preparatory to the abolition of slavery in the whole
country by Congress. The antislavery party rejoiced that at last an
opportunity had come for freeing the national capital from the disgrace
of slavery. The bill passed both houses, and was approved April 16,
1862.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn361">361</a></sup> By the final section of the act the black code of Maryland <a id="was361"></a>was
wiped out, and the severe local provisions against fugitives, which had
not been repealed by the previous act, were at last taken away. It
remained only to attack the last stronghold of the system,&mdash;the two acts
of 1793 and 1850.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;99. Regulation<a id="s_aga"></a>s against kidnapping.</b> In the act of April 16, 1862, were
included regulations against kidnapping,&mdash;a practice made easy by the
unsettled state of the country. It seems to have been largely carried on
not only by Southerners, but also by unprincipled soldiers connected with
the Union army. The Liberator of March 27, 1863, notices such a case.
Some men from the 99th Regiment of New York Volunteers kidnapped a free
colored man at Norfolk, Virginia. They took his horse, cart, and the
provisions which he had just bought, and offered him for sale to be sent
South. During the absence of his captors for a few moments, the man was
able to work off his bonds and to escape in the darkness. He immediately
went before a provost marshal, told his story, and recognized one of his
captors who was just entering the door. What the consequences of this
meeting were the "Liberator" does not tell us; but the impression is
given that the negro was saved from his <a id="pursuers362"></a>pursuers.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn362">362</a></sup></p>




<h3><span>Repeal of the Acts proposed.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;100. Repe<a id="al_of"></a>al of the Fugitive Slave Acts.</b>&mdash;By the successive acts of
Congress and the President, the legal effect of the Fugitive Slave Laws
was now confined practically to the limited area of the Border States. No
officer, civil or military, could return a fugitive into the Confederate
lines. Slavery was forbidden in the District of Columbia, and there could
be no escapes thence; and Congress forbade the use of the jails of the
District for the confinement of fugitives from slaveholding regions. In
the free States the rendition of slaves, though still legally required,
had long since ceased. The final step was delayed till 1864.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;101. <a id="Early_propositions_to"></a>Early propositions to repeal the acts.</b>&mdash;Repeal, however, was
preceded by many earlier propositions. The Committee on the Judiciary, to
which was referred Mr. Howe's bill, presented <a id="December363"></a>December 26, 1861,<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn363">363</a></sup> did
not report until 1863, and then with the opinion that it ought not to
pass. In introducing his repeal measure, Mr. Howe spoke of the bill of
1850 as one "which has probably done as much mischief as any other one
act that was ever passed by the national legislature. It has embittered
against each other two great sections of the <a id="country364"></a>country."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn364">364</a></sup> To take away
the law of 1850 would leave in force the act of 1793, which was "good
enough."</p>

<p>June 9, 1862, soon after the passage of the acts on the District of
Columbia, Mr. Julian presented in the House another repeal bill, which
was referred to the Committee on the <a id="Judiciary365"></a>Judiciary.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn365">365</a></sup> As the war
progressed, and the antislavery sentiment began to outweigh all others,
it became evident that the old law could not much longer obtain.
Nevertheless the question was set aside during the session of 1862-63,
but in 1863-64 five bills were introduced looking to the repeal of the
<a id="acts366"></a>acts.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn366">366</a></sup></p>

<p>Mr. Morris, from the committee to whom all bills for repeal had been
referred, reported a substitute for them, June 6, 1864, and this was the
basis of the final action of <a id="Congress367"></a>Congress.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn367">367</a></sup></p>





<h3><span>Discussion of Repeal Bills.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;102. Disc<a id="ussi"></a>ussion of the repeal bill in the House.</b>&mdash;Had the country been
divided simply into two parts, the slaveholding Southern Confederacy and
the free loyal North, little discussion could have arisen. The third
element, the slaveholding States which remained firm for the Union,
rendered the question far more complex. The bill therefore aroused much
indignation. Mr. Mallory demanded, as an act of justice to his State,
that "the Fugitive Slave Act be permitted to remain on the statute-book.
If you say it will be a dead letter, so much less excuse have you for
repealing it, and so much more certainly is the insult and wrong to
Kentucky gratuitous. This act, by which you declare your intention not to
obey the injunction of the Constitution is wanton and useless, except for
the purpose of bravely exhibiting your contempt for that instrument."
"The framers of the Constitution gave us the right to reclaim fugitive
slaves. It was conceded not as a favor, but as a right." "Kentucky has
remained true to her faith pledged to the government, and I warn you not
to persevere in inflicting on her insult and <a id="outrage368"></a>outrage."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn368">368</a></sup></p>

<p>Again, one of the reasons for the departure of the Southern States, was
the "bad faith of the Northern States,&mdash;the fatal infringement of this
part of the Constitution. It was because of Personal Liberty bills, John
Brown raids, and general denunciation and intermeddling with
<a id="slavery369"></a>slavery."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn369">369</a></sup> Many members urged that there could be no more reckless
action than to show to the Border States an apparent disregard of the
Constitution. Mr. Cox considered the law the only refuge left to a
certain class of citizens to protect their "rights." It would be like
saying to them, We place the penalty of the treason of the revolted
slaveholders on your innocent heads. "We add to your calamities the
ingratitude and treachery of the government to which you have
<a id="adhered370"></a>adhered."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn370">370</a></sup></p>

<p>The final discussion, June 13, opened with a long speech by Mr. King. The
old arguments from the Constitution, the far-seeing wisdom of the
fathers, the opinion of the Supreme Court in the Prigg case, and the harm
done the Border States, were again <a id="rehearsed371"></a>rehearsed.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn371">371</a></sup></p>


<p>In answer to Mr. King, Mr. Hubbard denied that the Constitution provided
for the enactment of a law by Congress, and in any case, the
treason of slavery had already absolved the people from any such
obligation. It surely must be competent for this Congress to repeal any
act which a previous Congress had enacted. For yet another reason the law
should be repealed. Negro soldiers must be enlisted: "You cannot draft
black men into the field, while your marshals are chasing women and
children in the woods of Ohio with a view to render them back into
bondage. The moral sense of the nation, ay, of the world, would revolt at
<a id="it372"></a>it."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn372">372</a></sup> Again, this would make a conflict in our laws, said Mr. Morris.
A colored man might enlist in our army, then, under the Fugitive Slave
Law, "he might be seized and remanded to slavery; and as a further
consequence, dealt with as a deserter from his post of <a id="duty373"></a>duty."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn373">373</a></sup> It was
also urged that unless slavery was to survive the war, the two acts were
useless and obsolete statutes, which ought to be wiped out of existence.
No one who believes that slavery is dead would desire to keep such a
guaranty of the <a id="institution374"></a>institution.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn374">374</a></sup> Mr. Hubbard then demanded the yeas and
nays on the passage of the bill. It was declared in the affirmative, yeas
82, nays 57, and thus the repeal was successfully carried in the
<a id="House375"></a>House.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn375">375</a></sup></p>


<p><b>§&nbsp;103. Repeal bills <a id="in_the_Senate"></a>in the Senate.</b>&mdash;Mr. Sumner had already reported a
repeal bill from the Committee on Slavery and Freedom in the Senate,
<a id="February376"></a>February 29, 1864.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn376">376</a></sup> The progress of the bill was so delayed by the
opposition, that Mr. Sumner at last gave notice that he should take every
proper occasion to call up the bill, and press its <a id="consideration377"></a>consideration.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn377">377</a></sup></p>



<p>In the debate several speeches were made against the measure, while Mr.
Sumner defended it. To the antislavery party the act was
<a id="constitutionally378"></a>constitutionally<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn378">378</a></sup> and morally wrong, so against public sentiment that
it could seldom be enforced, and the question of its repeal was as plain
as a "diagram," "the multiplication table," or "the ten
<a id="commandments379"></a>commandments."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn379">379</a></sup> They desired to strike slavery wherever they could
hit it, and to "purify the statute-book, so that there should be nothing
in it out of which this wrong can derive any support." It should be
repealed for the sake of our cause in foreign <a id="lands380"></a>lands.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn380">380</a></sup> "Since the
outbreak of the Rebellion this statute has been constantly
adduced by our enemies abroad as showing that we are little better than
Jefferson Davis and his slave-monger crew; for slavery never shows itself
worse than in the slave-hunter. It is a burden for our cause which it
ought not to be obliged to bear."</p>

<p>To retain the law of 1793, framed by the founders of the Republic, and
repeal the act of 1850 with its manifest injustice, was suggested as a
desirable compromise. Mr. Sherman, therefore, offered an amendment to
this effect, and it was <a id="accepted381"></a>accepted.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn381">381</a></sup> The friends of the measure then
felt that the bill as it stood was of little value to the antislavery
cause. Mr. Brown maintained that it was really a proposition to reinstate
slavery in its fastness in the Constitution. "The civilized world, when
it beholds the spectacle of the American Senate going back for three
quarters of a century to resurrect a statute of slave-catching, and pass
it anew with their indorsement, will credit very little all your talk
about freedom. The act will give the lie to all <a id="argument382"></a>argument."<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn382">382</a></sup></p>

<p>Before further action was taken on Mr. Sherman's bill, the repeal bill
from the House came before the Senate, and was reported from the
committee, June 15, 1864. It was discussed for several days, but no new
arguments were offered, and, June 23, 1864, the bill passed the Senate by
a vote of 27 <a id="to383"></a>to 12.<sup class="topnum">383</sup> On the 25th of June it received President
Lincoln's signature, and the Fugitive Slave Laws were swept from the
statute-book of the United <a id="States384"></a>States.<sup class="topnum"><a href="#fn384">384</a></sup></p>



<h3><span>Repeal of the Acts.</span></h3>

<p><b>§&nbsp;104. The repeal act and the <a id="thirteenth"></a>thirteenth amendment.</b>&mdash;The act was a simple
one; it runs as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p> "Chap. CLXVI. An Act to repeal the Fugitive Slave Act of eighteen
   hundred and fifty, and all Acts and parts of Acts for the rendition of
   Fugitive Slaves.</p>
<p> "<i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
   United States of America in Congress assembled</i>, That sections three
   and four of an act entitled 'An act respecting fugitives from justice,
   and persons escaping from the service of their masters,' passed
   February twelve, seventeen hundred and ninety-three, and an act
   entitled 'An act to amend, and supplementary to, the act entitled An
   act respecting fugitives from justice, and persons escaping from the
   service of their masters, passed February twelve, seventeen hundred and
   ninety-three,' passed September, eighteen hundred and
   fifty, be and the same are hereby repealed.</p>
<p>"Approved, June 28, 1864."</p>
</div>


<p>The whole structure of statutes, decisions, and judicial machinery which
had been erected to compel by national authority the people of free
States to share in the responsibility for slavery, was at last
overthrown. But the constitutional obligation remained; so long as a
slave anywhere existed, the neighboring States were bound to pursue him,
if he ran away, and might by statute provide for his return. The final
step was therefore to complete the work of legal emancipation by the
thirteenth amendment to the Constitution. On January 31, 1865, Congress
voted to submit the following article to the States for their approval
and ratification: "Art. XIII. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,
except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly
convicted, shall exist within the United States or any place subject to
their jurisdiction." On December 18, 1865, the Secretary of State
proclaimed that the amendment had been approved by twenty-seven of the
thirty-six States, and was consequently adopted.</p>

<p><b>§&nbsp;105. Educating effect of the con<a id="trov"></a>troversy.</b>&mdash;The first act of 1793 was
imperfect. It did not provide a national machinery whereby its provisions
could be executed, and many of the States by means of the personal
liberty laws refused to lend their officers and jails for the work. All
efforts to amend the law were unsuccessful until the great compromise of
1850 gave opportunity to pass a second act.</p>

<p>This new measure remedied certain defects in the first statute, and was
therefore more satisfactory to the slave-owners. As soon as it began to
be executed, however, its provisions were found to be so severe that the
trials and rescues it occasioned served only to educate the people to the
evils of slavery by bringing its effects close to them. Thus, far from
compelling the North to acquiesce in the system, it greatly increased the
number of Abolitionists. The arraying of the North and South against each
other in the Civil War intensified public sentiment upon the question,
and led more and more to a loose execution of the law. It was found
impracticable to return slaves to disloyal masters, and a law to prevent
any such return was the next step toward the doing away of the whole
system. Next came the question of the duty and power of the general
government, within its exclusive jurisdiction: in 1862 all
responsibility was disavowed. By this time the force of the law extended
only to the loyal slave States, and the force of public opinion in 1864
withdrew the last statutory safeguard of slavery under the Constitution.
A change in the text of the Constitution finally took away the force of
the clause on which the return of fugitives was based.</p>

<p>We can see, at this distance, how clearly slavery was doomed to
destruction, from the time the two sections first made it an issue in
1820; but there was no relation arising out of slavery except the
territorial question which did so much as the fugitive slave controversy
to hasten the downfall of the system. The contrast between the free
principles of democratic government and human bondage was forced upon the
attention of the North by the pursuit of fugitives in their midst. Yet
without national machinery for the recapture of runaways the institution
could not have long been maintained. There is no evidence that the North
was profoundly stirred by the horrors of slavery before 1850; it was only
when the North was called upon, in the Territories, and through the
Fugitive Slave Law, to give positive aid to the system that the
antislavery movement grew strong. Fugitive slaves and fugitive slave laws
helped to destroy slavery.</p>

 [§&nbsp;<a href="#app">25.</a>]</span></h4>

<p><b>1842.</b> "Upon this ground we have not the slightest hesitation in holding
that, under and in virtue of the Constitution, the owner of a slave is
clothed with entire authority, in every state in the Union, to seize and
recapture his slave, whenever he can do it without any breach of the
peace, or any illegal violence."</p>

<p>"The clause is found in the national Constitution, and not in that of any
state. It does not point out any state functionaries, or any state
actions to carry its provisions into effect. The states cannot,
therefore, be compelled to enforce them; and it might well be deemed an
unconstitutional exercise of the power of interpretation, to insist that
the states are bound to provide means to carry into effect the duties of
the national government nowhere delegated or intrusted to them
by the Constitution."</p>

<p>"If this be so, then it would seem, upon just principles of construction,
that the legislation of Congress, if constitutional, must supersede all
state legislation upon the same subject; and by necessary implication
prohibit it."</p>

<p>"As to the authority so conferred upon state magistrates, while a
difference of opinion has existed, and may exist still on the point, in
different states, whether state magistrates are bound to act under it;
none is entertained by this Court that state magistrates may, if they
choose, exercise that authority, unless prohibited by state
legislation."&mdash;<i>16 Peters, Justice Story's Opinion, 608.</i></p>

consequence of such appointment, are authorized to exercise the powers
that any justice of the peace, or other magistrate of any of the United

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the Superior Court of each
organized Territory of the United States shall have the same power to
appoint commissioners to take acknowledgments of bail and affidavits, and
to take depositions of witnesses in civil causes, which is now possessed
by the Circuit Court of the United States; and all commissioners who
shall hereafter be appointed for such purposes by the Superior Court of
any organized Territory of the United States, shall possess all the
powers, and exercise all the duties, conferred by law upon the
commissioners appointed by the Circuit Courts of the United States for
similar purposes, and shall moreover exercise and discharge all the
powers and duties conferred by this act.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 3.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the Circuit Courts of the
United States, and the Superior Courts of each organized Territory of the
United States, shall from time to time enlarge the number of
commissioners, with a view to afford reasonable facilities to reclaim
fugitives from labor, and to the prompt discharge of the duties imposed
by this act.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 4.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the commissioners above named
shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the judges of the Circuit and
District Courts of the United States, in their respective circuits and
districts within the several States, and the judges of the Superior
Courts of the Territories, severally and collectively, in term-time and
vacation; and shall grant certificates to such claimants, upon
satisfactory proof being made, with authority to take and remove such
fugitives from service or labor, under the restrictions herein contained,
to the State or Territory from which such persons may have escaped or
fled.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 5.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That it shall be the duty of all
marshals and deputy marshals to obey and execute all warrants and
precepts issued under the provisions of this act, when to them directed;
and should any marshal or deputy marshal refuse to receive such warrant,
or other process, when tendered, or to use all proper means diligently to
execute the same, he shall, on conviction thereof, be fined in the sum of
one thousand dollars, to the use of such claimant, on the motion of such
claimant by the Circuit or District Court for the district of such
marshal; and after arrest of such fugitive, by such marshal or his
deputy, or whilst at any time in his custody under the provisions of this
act, should such fugitive escape, whether with or without the assent of
such marshal or his deputy, such marshal shall be liable, on his official
bond, to be prosecuted for the benefit of such claimant, for the full
value of the service or labor of said fugitive in the State, Territory,
or District whence he escaped: and the better to enable the said
commissioners, when thus appointed, to execute their duties faithfully
and efficiently, in conformity with the requirements of the Constitution
of the United States and of this act, they are hereby authorized and
empowered, within their counties respectively, to appoint, in writing
under their hands, any one or more suitable persons, from time to time,
to execute all such warrants and other process as may be issued by them
in the lawful performance of their respective duties; with authority to
such commissioners, or the persons to be appointed by them, to execute
process as aforesaid, to summon and call to their aid the bystanders, or
<i>posse comitatus</i> of the proper county, when necessary to insure a
faithful observance of the clause of the Constitution referred to, in
conformity with the provisions of this act; and all good citizens are
hereby commanded to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient execution
of this law, whenever their services may be required, as aforesaid, for
that purpose; and said warrants shall run, and be executed by said
officers, anywhere in the State within which they are issued.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 6.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That when a person held to service
or labor in any State or Territory of the United States, has heretofore
or shall hereafter escape into another State or Territory of the United
States, the person or persons to whom such service or labor may be due,
or his, her, or their agent or attorney, duly authorized, by power of
attorney, in writing, acknowledged and certified under the seal of some
legal officer or court of the State or Territory in which the same may be
executed, may pursue and reclaim such fugitive person, either by
procuring a warrant from some one of the courts, judges, or commissioners
aforesaid, of the proper circuit, district, or county, for the
apprehension of such fugitive from service or labor, or by seizing and
arresting such fugitive, where the same can be done without process, and
by taking, or causing such person to be taken, forthwith before such
court, judge, or commissioner, whose duty it shall be to hear and
determine the case of such claimant in a summary manner; and upon
satisfactory proof being made, by deposition or affidavit, in writing, to
be taken and certified by such court, judge, or commissioner, or by other
satisfactory testimony, duly taken and certified by some court,
magistrate, justice of the peace, or other legal officer authorized to
administer an oath and take depositions under the laws of the State or
Territory from which such person owing service or labor may have escaped,
with a certificate of such magistracy or other authority, as aforesaid,
with the seal of the proper court or officer thereto attached, which seal
shall be sufficient to establish the competency of the proof, and with
proof, also by affidavit, of the identity of the person whose service or
labor is claimed to be due as aforesaid, that the person so arrested does
in fact owe service or labor to the person or persons claiming him or
her, in the State or Territory from which such fugitive may have escaped
as aforesaid, and that said person escaped, to make out and deliver to
such claimant, his or her agent or attorney, a certificate setting forth
the substantial facts as to the service or labor due from such fugitive
to the claimant, and of his or her escape from the State or Territory in
which such service or labor was due, to the State or Territory in which
he or she was arrested, with authority to such claimant, or his or her
agent or attorney, to use such reasonable force and restraint as may be
necessary, under the circumstances of the case, to take and remove such
fugitive person back to the State or Territory whence he or she may have
escaped as aforesaid. In no trial or hearing under this act shall the
testimony of such alleged fugitive be admitted in evidence; and the
certificates in this and the first [fourth] section mentioned, shall be
conclusive of the right of the person or persons in whose favor granted,
to remove such fugitive to the State or Territory from which he escaped,
and shall prevent all molestation of such person or persons by any
process issued by any court, judge, magistrate, or other person
whomsoever.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 7.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That any person who shall knowingly
and willingly obstruct, hinder, or prevent such claimant, his agent or
attorney, or any person or persons lawfully assisting him, her,
or them, from arresting such a fugitive from service or labor, either
with or without process as aforesaid, or shall rescue, or attempt to
rescue, such fugitive from service or labor, from the custody of such
claimant, his or her agent or attorney, or other person or persons
lawfully assisting as aforesaid, when so arrested, pursuant to the
authority herein given and declared; or shall aid, abet, or assist such
person so owing service or labor as aforesaid, directly or indirectly, to
escape from such claimant, his agent or attorney, or other person or
persons legally authorized as aforesaid; or shall harbor or conceal such
fugitive, so as to prevent the discovery and arrest of such person, after
notice or knowledge of the fact that such person was a fugitive from
service or labor as aforesaid, shall, for either of said offences, be
subject to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, and imprisonment
not exceeding six months, by indictment and conviction before the
District Court of the United States for the district in which such
offence may have been committed, or before the proper court of criminal
jurisdiction, if committed within any one of the organized Territories of
the United States; and shall moreover forfeit and pay, by way of civil
damages to the party injured by such illegal conduct, the sum of one
thousand dollars, for each fugitive so lost as aforesaid, to be recovered
by action of debt, in any of the District or Territorial Courts
aforesaid, within whose jurisdiction the said offence may have been
committed.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 8.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the marshals, their deputies,
and the clerks of the said District and Territorial Courts, shall be
paid, for their services, the like fees as may be allowed to them for
similar services in other cases; and where such services are rendered
exclusively in the arrest, custody, and delivery of the fugitive to the
claimant, his or her agent or attorney, or where such supposed fugitive
may be discharged out of custody for the want of sufficient proof as
aforesaid, then such fees are to be paid in the whole by such claimant,
his agent or attorney; and in all cases where the proceedings are before
a commissioner, he shall be entitled to a fee of ten dollars in full for
his services in each case, upon the delivery of the said certificate to
the claimant, his or her agent or attorney; or a fee of five dollars in
cases where the proof shall not, in the opinion of such commissioner,
warrant such certificate and delivery, inclusive of all services incident
to such arrest and examination, to be paid, in either case, by the
claimant, his or her agent or attorney. The person or persons authorized
to execute the process to be issued by such commissioners for the arrest
and detention of fugitives from service or labor as aforesaid, shall also
be entitled to a fee of five dollars each for each person he or they may
arrest and take before any such commissioner as aforesaid, at the
instance and request of such claimant, with such other fees as may be
deemed reasonable by such commissioner for such other additional services
as may be necessarily performed by him or them; such as attending at the
examination, keeping the fugitive in custody, and providing him with food
and lodging during his detention, and until the final determination of
such commissioner; and, in general, for performing such other duties as
may be required by such claimant, his or her attorney or agent, or
commissioner in the premises, such fees to be made up in conformity with
the fees usually charged by the officers of the courts of justice within
the proper district or county, as near as may be practicable, and paid by
such claimants, their agents or attorneys, whether such supposed
fugitives from service or labor be ordered to be delivered to such
claimants by the final determination of such commissioners or not.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 9.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That, upon affidavit made by the
claimant of such fugitive, his agent or attorney, after such certificate
has been issued, that he has reason to apprehend that such fugitive will
be rescued by force from his or their possession before he can be taken
beyond the limits of the State in which the arrest is made, it shall be
the duty of the officer making the arrest to retain such fugitive in his
custody, and to remove him to the State whence he fled, and there to
deliver him to said
 claimant, his agent, or attorney. And to
this end, the officer aforesaid is hereby authorized and required to
employ so many persons as he may deem necessary to overcome such force,
and to retain them in his service so long as circumstances may require.
The said officer and his assistants, while so employed, to receive the
same compensation, and to be allowed the same expenses, as are now
allowed by law for transportation of criminals, to be certified by the
judge of the district within which the arrest is made, and paid out of
the treasury of the United States.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sec. 10.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That when any person held to
service or labor in any State or Territory, or in the District of
Columbia, shall escape therefrom, the party to whom such service or labor
shall be due, his, her, or their agent or attorney, may apply to any
court of record therein, or judge thereof in vacation, and make
satisfactory proof to such court, or judge in vacation, of the escape
aforesaid, and that the person escaping owed service or labor to such
party. Whereupon the court shall cause a record to be made of the matters
so proved, and also a general description of the person so escaping, with
such convenient certainty as may be; and a transcript of such record,
authenticated by the attestation of the clerk and of the seal of the said
court, being produced in any other State, Territory, or district in which
the person so escaping may be found, and being exhibited to any judge,
commissioner, or other officer authorized by the law of the United States
to cause persons escaping from service or labor to be delivered up, shall
be held and taken to be full and conclusive evidence of the fact of
escape, and that the service or labor of the person escaping is due to
the party in such record mentioned. And upon the production by the said
party of other and further evidence if necessary, either oral or by
affidavit, in addition to what is contained in the said record of the
identity of the person escaping, he or she shall be delivered up to the
claimant. And the said court, commissioner, judge, or other person
authorized by this act to grant certificates to claimants of fugitives,
shall, upon the production of the record and other evidences aforesaid,
grant to such claimant a certificate of his right to take any such person
identified and proved to be owing service or labor as aforesaid, which
certificate shall authorize such claimant to seize or arrest and
transport such person to the State or Territory from which he escaped:
<i>Provided</i>, That nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring
the production of a transcript of such record as evidence as aforesaid.
But in its absence the claim shall be heard and determined upon other
satisfactory proofs, competent in law.</p>

<h4><span>1. <a id="Sources"></a>Sources of information.</span></h4>

<p>There are many sources from which material for a study of fugitive slaves
may be gathered. Almost any work upon the slavery question touches sooner
or later upon this topic, and the difficulties arise rather from the
amount of the literature which must be examined than from lack of
information. No formal bibliography of the subject, or of any phase of
it, has been found; it has therefore been necessary to go through a large
body of material, and to sift out references which bear upon the subject.</p>

<h4><span>2. <a id="Libraries"></a>Libraries.</span></h4>

<p>The labor has been much facilitated by the completeness and convenient
arrangement of the literature bearing upon slavery in the libraries of
Cambridge and Boston. The Harvard College Library possesses two unique
collections of slavery pamphlets, one the bequest of Charles Sumner, the
other the gift of Colonel T. W. Higginson; and the Card Catalogue of the
Library is a comprehensive guide to a large alcove of other books. The
great collections of the Boston Public Library have also been made
accessible by the full Card Catalogue of that Library. The Boston
Athenæum has also furnished valuable material; and in the Massachusetts
State Library is an excellent set of State Statutes, which has been
freely used. I have not been able to consult the antislavery collection
of the Cornell Library at Ithaca.</p>

<h4><span>3. <a id="Secondary_works"></a>Secondary works.</span></h4>

<p>The material upon fugitive slaves, as upon any topic, may be divided into
two classes, secondary and original. The general and local histories
which come under the first class have been of good service as guides to
further investigation. <i>The Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America</i>,
by <i>Henry Wilson</i>, takes up the whole question of slavery in a thorough
manner, and devotes special attention to the debates in Congress. Though
long and ill-arranged, it is comprehensive and trustworthy.
Unfortunately, the work is not provided with foot-notes. <i>Williams's
History of the Negro Race</i>, and <i>Greeley's American Conflict</i>, are other
surveys of the whole subject. For a discussion of political forces and
constitutional questions, <i>Von Holst</i> is the best authority, while
<i>Hurd</i>, besides enumerating the statutes from colonial times down,
considers the subject with great clearness from a judicial point
of view, describes many cases, and in foot-notes gives references to
others.</p>

<p>Studies of colonial slavery are found in <i>Lodge's English Colonies in
America</i> and <i>Doyle's English in America</i>. Several special essays have
been printed on slavery in Massachusetts; <i>Deane's</i> and <i>Moore's Notes on
Slavery</i>, and <i>Washburn's Extinction of Slavery in Massachusetts</i>. Little
attention is in any of these works given to fugitive slaves.</p>

<p>To another class belong books descriptive of the institution of slavery.
<i>Mrs. Frances Kemble</i> wrote about life on a Southern plantation before
the war, and the <i>Cotton Kingdom</i> and other volumes by <i>Frederick Law
Olmsted</i> give many interesting details, and furnished me with much
material for the chapter on Fugitives and their Friends.</p>

<h4><span>4. <a id="Biographies"></a>Biographies.</span></h4>

<p>Biographies of antislavery men are likely to contain information on
fugitive slave cases. The <i>Life of Isaac T. Hopper</i> is full of accounts
of his ways of aiding flight, and for the same reason the <i>Life of Gerrit
Smith</i> is exceedingly interesting. Birney's <i>Life of James G. Birney</i>
deals little with fugitives. The biographies of Mrs. Lydia Maria Child,
Arthur and Lewis Tappan, John Brown, Garrison, Phillips, and the Grimké
sisters, may also be mentioned. Others, like those of Jonathan Walker, L.
W. Paine, Daniel Drayton, captain of the schooner Pearl, W. L. Chaplin,
Work, Burr, and Thompson, and the recently published <i>Life of Rev. Calvin
Colman</i>, relate simply the stories of trials and imprisonments for aiding
fugitives, and are often more in the nature of original than secondary
sources.</p>

<h4><span>5. <a id="Original_sources"></a>Original sources.</span></h4>

<p>Very early in the preparation of this work it became evident that no
writer had systematically examined and compared the legislation of the
Colonies and States, or searched the records of Congress, or looked for
contemporary accounts of any considerable number of escapes. I was
therefore obliged to search for such original material as was within my
reach. Doubtless some important books and pamphlets have escaped me, and
an examination of other collections would enlarge the bibliography; but
the effort has been made to exhaust the literature of the subject, except
in newspapers.</p>

<h4><span>6. <a id="Slave_autobiographies"></a>Slave autobiographies.</span></h4>

<p>Out of the great variety of original sources containing descriptions of
slave life and escapes, the autobiographies of the slaves themselves are
the most interesting, and often the saddest. The Rev. James Freeman
Clarke says, in his Antislavery Days: "Even now, when it is all over, the
flesh creeps and the blood curdles in the veins at the accounts of the
dreadful cruelties practised on slaves in many parts of the South. I
would advise no one to read such histories to-day unless his nerves are
very well strung." <i>Frederick Douglass</i> has given us two books, one
written before slavery was abolished, and a fuller account afterward,
when it was no longer imprudent to reveal the whole story of his escape.
Many of these lives were published by antislavery people, who wished by
such means to rouse the North. Such are the stories of <i>Box Brown</i>,
<i>Peter Still</i>, <i>Archy Moore</i>, <i>Solomon Northrup</i>, <i>Lunsford Lane</i>, and
others, most of which have been quoted above.</p>

<h4><span>7. <a id="Records_of_trials"></a>Records of trials.</span></h4>

<p>Much descriptive detail can often be found in the published reports of
trials. A volume is devoted to the Oberlin-Wellington case, and several
volumes have been published on the Burns trial. For the Prigg and Hanway
cases, and others of importance, the records of the Supreme Court and
lower courts have been consulted. Most of the important cases were tried
in State courts or before commissioners, and the only reports are
fugitive pamphlets, of which many have been consulted and cited.</p>


 <h4><span>8. Sp<a id="eeche"></a>eeches.</span></h4>

<p>In the study of public sentiment and for the weighing of argument the
speeches of <i>Phillips</i>, <i>Sumner</i>, <i>Seward</i>, <i>Giddings</i>, <i>Webster</i>,
<i>Mann</i>, <i>Rantoul</i>, <i>Loring</i>, and others, are of the greatest value. They
often throw light upon obscure cases, and the fugitive slave stories
brought in as illustrations have sometimes led to the discovery of
interesting and forgotten cases.</p>

<h4><span>9. <a id="Reminiscences"></a>Reminiscences.</span></h4>

<p>A valuable aid in reconstructing in the mind the conditions of the
slavery struggle are the reminiscences of participants. <i>Rev. James
Freeman Clarke's Antislavery Days</i> and <i>Mr. Parker Pillsbury's</i> book have
been helpful in these chapters. A pamphlet by <i>Mr. Austin Bearse</i>
describes the Fugitive Slave Laws in Boston, and relates the work of the
Vigilance Committee in protecting escaped negroes. The books of <i>Still</i>,
<i>Smedley</i>, and <i>Coffin</i>, on the workings of the Underground Railroad, are
composed chiefly of reminiscences, and have furnished many essential
facts.</p>

<h4><span>10. <a id="Reports"></a>Reports of societies.</span></h4>

<p>The reports of the various antislavery societies, especially of those of
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, have also been examined with profit as to
the work among the refugees in Canada, etc. For the colonial period the
publications of the Massachusetts and New York Historical Societies are
exceedingly important, and have been freely drawn upon.</p>

<h4><span>11. <a id="Periodicals"></a>Periodicals and newspapers.</span></h4>

<p>Not much has been gathered from periodicals. <i>Poole's Index</i> was used and
occasionally something of importance was discovered. Thus <i>The Freedman's
Story</i> in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> has furnished one of the most striking
of the stories about resistance to escapes. Such articles are few, and
occur long after the slavery period, when such disclosures were no longer
unpopular. <i>The Magazine of American History</i> contains Several articles.
Among newspapers, the <i>Liberator</i> is without doubt the most complete
record of the extreme antislavery sentiment toward the fugitive slave
laws and their workings. Each case as it occurs is fully commented upon,
and in addition there is each week a column or two of atrocities, and
among them stories of fugitives are often given. The Harvard College
Library contains a complete file, which I have examined; and references
to the Liberator are therefore frequent throughout the work. The colonial
newspapers are of little value, except for the conclusions which may be
drawn from the advertisements for runaways. Newspapers of that time were
so limited in scope, that an affair so unimportant to them as a fugitive
slave case would scarcely appear.</p>

<h4><span>12. <a id="Materials"></a>Materials bearing on legislation.</span></h4>

<p>The materials for the study of colonial legislation must be gathered from
many sources. The best collection of them in Boston may be found at the
State Library. In some colonies there are carefully edited series of
volumes chronologically arranged, but in others the records have been but
irregularly printed. The laws of New Netherlands and of early New York
are easily accessible in well printed volumes of a recent date. For the
Southern States, the Hening edition of the Virginia Statutes at Large is
clear, and covers a long period. There is also the Cooper collection for
South Carolina, Bacon's series for Maryland, Iredell's edition of South
Carolina Statutes, and Leaming and Spicer for New Jersey. There are of
course many others, but these comprise the most important.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the Constitutional period, the proceedings of
Congress may be followed as minutely as desired. An outline of the
proceedings is given in the Journals of the Senate and House, while for a
fuller account and reports of speeches the Annals of Congress and
Congressional Debates to 1837, and the Congressional Globes from 1833 to
1863, furnish ample material. Information in regard to the number and

<p class="ind"><small><a id="fn169"></a><a href="#Massachusetts169">169</a></small> Mr. Quincy also states, that "about a fortnight elapsed, when I was called upon by
Rufus Green Amory, a lawyer of eminence at the Boston bar in that day, who showed
me a letter from a Southern slaveholder, directing him to prosecute Josiah Quincy for
the penalty under the law of 1793, for obstructing the agent of the claimant in obtaining
his slave under the process established by that law. Mr. Amory felt, no less than
myself, the folly of such a pretence; and I never heard from him, or from any one,
anything more upon the subject of prosecution. This fact, and the universal gratification
which the fact appeared to give to the public, satisfied my mind, that, unless by
accident, or stealth, or in some very thin settled part of the country, the law of 1793
would be forever inoperative, as the event has proved in Massachusetts."&mdash;Meeting
